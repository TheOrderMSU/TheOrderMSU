### The Rift and the Apexium

Following the death of The Sister as a result of Lady Xion's Thought Bomb (empowered by the united energies of the Sith and Jedi forces), a rift in space and time opened. Over the following weeks, strange but familiar beings began to emerge from this portal.

Fleeing the near total annihilation of the Jedi, alternate versions of this universe's Sith, who instead had become Jedi, ventured to the current universe. They were running from a being known as Darth Casficus and his apprentice, Tu'riel.

Darth Casficus, originally known as Natsirt Din ([Yahtel](https://github.com/TheOrderMSU/TheOrderMSU/wiki/Yathel)'s master), had risen to power after his universe's version of Order 66 had failed. The Jedi then publicly executed Emperor Palpatine. Acquiring Darth Plagueis' research, Casficus completed it and gained immortality.

Tu'riel ([Sigil](https://github.com/TheOrderMSU/TheOrderMSU/wiki/Sigil-Eldaki)'s brother), now at full power thanks to his father's experiments, was slowly burning from the inside out due to the dark side virus coursing through his veins. He swore himself to Casficus in exchange for the secrets to keep himself alive. In the meantime, he uses and enhanced version of the Dark Side power Force Drain to sustain his power.

Together these two Sith, and their Apexium of dark siders, waged war against this universe's Jedi and Sith as well as refugee's from their universe, including Light-aligned versions of Shadow, Rahn Uthsan ([Savage](https://github.com/TheOrderMSU/TheOrderMSU/wiki/Savage)), and others.

The Jedi and Sith combined forces once again and defeated the Apexium. They were defeated at the self-same portal that brought them to this universe.

Casficus attempted an empowered Force Tempest. He lost himself in his rage and was consumed by the tempest.

Tu'riel, overzealous in his powers and desperate to escape, tore through Jedi and Sith forces giving no acknowledgment to his wounds. He was dealt a final blow by Dark Lord Savage, mere meters from escaping through the portal.
