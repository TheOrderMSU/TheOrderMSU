## Introduction

### Clone Wars

Zerold was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at the age of three where he studied under the multiple instructors for younglings. He learned quickly and advanced past most in his class, but with this came a rising sense of pride that made him cocky. He began to rebel against most of the teacher's instructions, and then he was reassigned to a private instructor: Jedi Knight and instructor Yathel'con te D'mori. Under the serpentine Jedi's tutelage Zerold began learning how to appropriately humble himself after being showed just how much he had left to learn, though he continued to feel proud of himself and his abilities as he progressed.

After a while of being in the Temple, the Clone Wars began and the Jedi were spread wide and thin. In 19 BBY Zerold was tasked with making an errand run into the market just before Order 66 was issued. The young Miraluka escaped the massacre but was scared from the pain he felt through the Force, sensing the deaths of all the Jedi in the Temple. He managed to board a transport and aimlessly wandered the galaxy until he settled down on a rather deserted planet, still battling the Dark Side pressing in on him. Eventually he simply couldn't fight back any longer and the darkness took him, snuffing out his will to live.
