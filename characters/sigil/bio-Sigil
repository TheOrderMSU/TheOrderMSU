## Introduction

Sigil Eldaki is a Senator-in-exile for the Mirialan colony of Phiroth, Jedi Master and Shadow to former Grandmaster Izen. Since the exile of the Jedi from Coruscant and destruction of the Senate, Sigil still worked to maintain peaceful relations between the Jedi and the rest of the galaxy

Sigil is an accomplished Jedi healer, possessing significantly enhanced Force Healing capabilities. His Sith-made affliction once demanded much of his healing applications but has been abated by the planet Mortis.

A mainly defensive duelist during his padawan and knight training, Sigil prefered using defensive lightsaber forms, such as Soresu, to force his opponent to wear themselves down. Upon receiving his training for masterhood, Sigil became a more aggressive duelist, focusing on Ataru, Shien, and dagger styles. Sigil has earned high commendations from former Jedi Battlemater Daelan.

Though he was forced through grueling Dark Side teachings as a child, Sigil has been left with a sometimes ambiguous sense of the Jedi Code. Many years later, Sigil now follows the path of the Cosmic Force.

### Childhood

Sigil and his twin brother [ Tu’riel T'Nara ] were sent as children to the Jedi Order, as all young Force sensitives are. After their 5th birthday, they were removed from the Order by their estranged father, a medical doctor, and fallen Jedi, Kaito T’Nara. Kaito took the twins to be trained in the ways of the Dark Side and for use in his own nefarious experiments.

Tu’riel embraced their father’s teachings, while Sigil had interest in the teachings for knowledge’s sake, he did not like the application of the Dark Side. He had little of the hatred inside that his brother did, having an even and calm demeanor more like his mother, Madoka Eldaki. Sigil’s demeanor infuriated his father and brother, both believing that such an outlook stagnated their abilities. Sigil had ample latent Force potential but did not use it, though he lacked lightsaber combat skills. Tu’riel had average Force potential but superior lightsaber techniques.

Their father had been furthering, and perverting, the work on immortality previously started by Darth Tenebrous and Darth Plagueis. He called his new variation “Scar” after the effect it left on the test subject’s skin. Kaito did not have as advanced knowledge as the former two Sith lords, instead he focused on adapting it to a specific genetic makeup, that of his twin sons. He had planned to perfect the formula on them in case one died, he had a spare. If the formula worked, he would then use ancient Sith alchemy to transfer his spirit into that of his surviving son. Tu’riel showed more inclination to the dark side and was chosen as the first host.

Kaito’s virus was only semi-successful, slowing Tu’riel’s aging and accelerating physical prowess but the process itself was detrimental. No one can truly bend the Dark Side to their service. The virus amplified healing, so much so that it could burn out the host body in a matter of weeks. Tu’riel was placed into cryo-stasis.

Over the next few weeks, Kaito became distant from his other son and altogether abandoned Sigil’s training, treating the boy as little more than a pest. Kaito considered his son a failure. It ate at the father like cancer until he struck out at the boy with his lightsaber. Sigil defended himself against the rage fueled strikes. Kaito had been so focused on his virus over the years that he let his lightsaber abilities lapse. The father could not break through Sigil’s defenses.

### Senator Eldaki

Sigil returned home to his mother, Madoka Eldaki, then senator for Phiroth and adopted her family name: Eldaki. Sigil integrated into proper society and accelerated through his schooling. Madoka suppressed any information that Sigil had been raised by his father and under Sith teachings. He came to study medicine like his father, seeking to use his knowledge to help others instead of harming them. Madoka disapproved of the medical training and insisted that Sigil study the arts alongside to maintain his balance. Turning his Sith teachings around, he came to focus on Force Healing and its applications, being careful to conceal his Force training from other students and teachers.

When he was 20 (410ABY) his mother died in a catastrophic inter-orbital transport accident. Many hundreds died. While the turmoil unfolded, Sigil reluctantly stepped into her position. The following year he was elected formally. The colony thrived under Sigil’s watch. He bolstered the arts and medical sciences of the colony. For four years society flourished and Phiroth became a shining beacon for healthy life and culture in the Outer Rim.

During this time he became reacquainted with the Jedi Order through various workings. At one point after a Senate session, he was approached by Jedi Knight Yathel, who knew of Sigil’s Force sensitive nature and could see the training, and invited him to come back into the folds of the Order. It was a rather unorthodox request for one who had been gone from the Order for so long, much less raised on Sith teachings. Yathel was confident, though. He could sense nothing but good intentions in Sigil and his actions, on and for Phiroth, bolstered those intentions. Sigil declined the master’s offer, insisting that he needed to be with his people on Phiroth. The master accepted the rejection, stating that the Order would be there for him should the senator ever need them.

### War on Phiroth

Over the next three years the colony of Phiroth subtly changed. Where the leaders had been so willing to work with Sigil and expand the culture and influence of their world, now the other leaders seem indifferent and bullish toward the young Senator. His influence slowly waned, eventually being shut out of meetings and votes entirely.

Anger and resentment fill the holonet on Phiroth. The situation escalates during Sigil’s 7th year (417 ABY) as a senator. He spends more time on Coruscant quelling rumors and having his time wasted by pointless debates. His political rivals use this to their advantage, rallying the colony against their senator.

Everything falls apart when at the ten year anniversary of the transport accident that claimed Sigil’s mother and hundreds of others, explosions decimate the capital. An invasion army, consisting of smugglers, bounty hunters, mercenaries and Mandalorians, led by Sigil’s sibling, Tu’riel, now out of cryo-stasis and drenched in dark side energy, had come to the colony.

Sigil pleads for negotiations, not wanting any more harm to come to his citizens. Negotiations fail. The government collapses under the overwhelming force. Citizens are scattered, families broken and the city in ashes.  Sigil is forced underground, Tu’riel had placed a bounty on his brother. He is unable to leave the planet, all outbound shuttles are grounded or shot down. He contacts the Senate but they refuse to offer aid. Sigil survives by honing his mind affecting Force powers and making use of his healing powers.

Weeks later, Sigil manages to acquire transport and escape his colony. He heads deeper into the Outer Rim to escape his brother’s searches. Coruscant turns its back on him, charges of treason flying from the mouths of his former compatriots. They say that Sigil knew of the impending invasion and let Tu'riel attack the capital.

### The Lost Years

For two years Sigil remains in exile in the Outer Rim. Sigil blames himself for the fate of his planet. He bounces between odd jobs while helping those in need. Little comes back to him, living a thankless life among the disenfranchised and downtrodden. False friendships and romantic betrayals follow Sigil from planet to planet. Sigil becomes emaciated and falls into a deep depression.

Out among the stars, on an unnamed moon full of smugglers, thieves and scum, Sigil gives up. For weeks he lay curled in an alleyway with little food, water and no sleep. Somewhere between life and death Sigil had a vision through the Force.

He could never recall the exact nature of the vision, as the Force works in mysterious ways. He only knew there were two voices working in harmony. They desperately urged him to return to Phiroth. Sigil does as the Force wills.

### Facing Tu'riel

>“Is that?… How dare you use father’s blade against me!”
>
>Tu’riel in his battle against Sigil

Sigil claws his way out of the gutter, slowly recovering and making his way back to Phiroth. There he returns to his mother’s home. It is long abandoned and covered in dust, more a monument than living space. Sigil walks to the living quarters and opens an old locked trunk. There in silver and onyx lies pieces of his father’s lightsaber. Sigil rebuilds the old weapon and silver light illuminates the room. From muscle memory flow katas long forgotten. The familiar patterns of the Force channel their way through Sigil’s body.

At dawn the next morning, Sigil enters the capital. The old guards, those that swore against their senator, are still there. Those that do not immediately lower their weapons are incapacitated. Sigil effortlessly makes his way to the main oration hall. A televised committee meeting is taking place. Tu’riel is caught by surprise. Sigil rushes the podium and Force pushes Tu’riel through the building’s wall and down several stories onto the steps of the capitol building. Tu’riel ignites his blade and charges Sigil. In a flash Sigil ignites his father’s blade and holds Tu’riel’s blade at bay.

The entire battle is broadcast via holo-net across the planet. Tu’riel unleashes, destroying much of the area around them. The brothers battle to a standstill, disarming each other of their lightsabers. None of Sigil’s lightsaber strikes seemed to harm Tu’riel for long and Tu’riel cannot breach Sigil’s Soresu defenses.

The twins switched to a battle of the Force. Tu’riel gains the upper hand early on, injuring Sigil’s arm with Force Lightning blasts. Tu’riel boasts about their father’s virus and his immortality. Sigil reflects a blast of Force Lightning back and causes an overload on Tu’riel’s hand. The brother’s clasp hands and Sigil sends his Force Healing into his brother. Tu’riel laughs until smoke starts to rise out of his body and his arms start to blacken. Sigil pushes Tu’riel’s already accelerated healing to massive levels, burning him from the inside out. His brother pushes back, forcing Dark Side energy into Sigil’s body: an internal struggle of will. A dark little voice speaks inside of Sigil. He reverses course and draws the healing energy out of Tu’riel.

Tu’riel collapses, a blackened and desiccated corpse. Victory came at a cost: Sigil became infected by the Scar virus as the brothers were grappling. Sigil claims Tu’riel’s lightsaber.

When the fighting subsides, the planetary leaders appear on the holonet screens. They condemn Sigil and his brother. They call for Sigil’s arrest. However, cooler heads prevail and Sigil is able to negotiate. Tu’riel had been the source of political tensions for years, and with his death, true leadership could return. The ruler body voted to exile Sigil, retaining rights and privileges but unable to set foot on the planet.

Battered and exiled, he arrives on Coruscant where the Jedi Temple awaits him.

### Rejoining the Jedi Order and Reuniting with Grandmaster Izen

Upon arriving at the Jedi Temple, Sigil was greeted on the steps by the Grandmaster of the Jedi Order, Izen. The Kel-dor Jedi greeted Sigil warmly, as one would an old friend returning from a journey. It would not be for several years that Sigil would know why.

Grandmaster Izen, with no hesitation or formality (which Sigil would learn would be the norm for Izen), took Sigil as his apprentice.

Sigil spent several months at the Temple recovering from his battle with Tu'riel. This was due to the way the Scar Virus was interacting with his body. Sigil was afraid that the virus would overtake and corrupt him to the Dark Side. This was precisely what was causing the delay in recovering: his own fear feeding the dark side virus.

During this time, Sigil spent hours watching the Jedi train. It was curious to him. His father had never been much of an instructor and to see the Jedi in their prime was inspiring.

Within five months, Sigil's body and mental state had adapted to the virus, allowing him to actively participate in the training. Soon he was able to pass his trial and advance to apprentice rank.

Izen trained Sigil in Form 3, Soresu, which, defensively, was a great match for Sigil. His defensive abilities became well known among the Jedi.

Sigil felt his offensive abilities had become a bit stunted, being forbidden from practicing the style from his youth, Makashi. Little did he know that Izen had plans for Sigil once he obtained Knighthood.

### The Broken Dagger

Upon attaining Knighthood, Izen begins to instruct Sigil in the use of a lightdagger a.k.a. a Lightsaber shoto. [ Lightsaber shoto ]

Sigil is reluctant to learn this form at first due to the dagger being a pure offense weapon and Sigil being a defensive based combatant. Gradually he warms up to the idea and begins training and using the dagger in earnest. Sigil felt a slight bit of a guilty pleasure at the surprise and uncertainty other Jedi felt whenever he would face them in sparring sessions.

In time, Sigil felt that he needed to build his own dagger. He carefully gathered the parts from different regions that he had visited, sure that his dagger would be a wonderful project to work on and a true test of his abilities. How wrong he was.

For months Sigil worked with the dagger, learning the construction techniques as he went. For all his efforts, the blade failed every single time. One part would function perfectly and another would fail. The amber energy blade would ignite and give a low satisfying hum, then Sigil would give the dagger a gentle swing and the energy blade would sizzle into nothing.

A few times he called upon Grandmaster Izen's expertise. Even putting their combined knowledge and ingenuity together, they could not get the blade to function properly.

Eventually Sigil decided to put the custom made dagger aside and instead visited the armory at the Jedi temple. There he found an old saber that had lain dormant for decades. With permission, Sigil took this saber, cleaned it up and added an appropriately named Sigil crystal to give it an amber colored blade.

Finally satisfied and having learned a lesson in patience and humility, Sigil was well on his way to becoming a powerful Jedi Knight.

### Yarne'coatl and Nabi, The First Apprentices

Nearing the end of his Knighthood, a young Bothan Jedi approached Sigil. Introducing himself as Yarne'coatl, he asked Sigil to accept him as an apprentice. Sigil knew of the young one, having witnessed his trial of passage to Apprentice rank. Yarne'coatl was part of a rising group of padawans and was well known for a sliding strike deriving from a Soresu technique.

Being wary of interacting with anyone due to the nature of his virus ridden body, Sigil asked the young Jedi to let him contemplate the request. Sigil wasn't sure what to feel about the request. He was duly honored to be considered but at the same time unsure of himself. After seeking direction through the Force and some advice from his own master, Izen, Sigil agreed to Yarne'coatl's request.

The apprenticeship was not one to last though. Yarne'coatl was soon called to return to his homeworld.

After Yarne’coatl’s departure from the Order, Grandmaster Izen assigned Sigil a new charge: a young Togruta named Nabi. Being much younger than Yarne, around 8 or 9 years old, Nabi was a different entity all together. However, Sigil and her bonded quickly and a great partnership ensued. Sigil would teach Nabi everything he knew of the healing arts. Nabi was a very eager learner. She had her own past with wanting to learn the healing arts, and seeing Sigil’s viral state, wanted to help as well.

### The Jedi Who Fell Through Time

**_425 ABY_**

Seeking a way to rid himself of the Sith alchemical virus in his body, Sigil begins research into forbidden lore of the Sith. Master Jedi and Librarian of the Temple archives, Kreed, warns Sigil against such research and to be ever wary. Sigil assures Kreed that it will be a little different than the studies Sigil's father put him through at a young age.

Over the time that Sigil studied, he came across little that seemed to be relevant to his desires. That was until he came across a reference to an ancient Sith Lord and Mandlorian named Mugen, said to have mastered the healing arts. At that moment, the Force opened up to Sigil and gave him a gentle nudge. From there, Sigil leapt between volumes of lore and knowledge, tracking the Sith Lord's movements and references to artifacts.

It took months but Sigil was eventually guided to a being who knew the resting location of a holocron created by Mugen himself. Within was all of the knowledge of healing that the Mandalore himself had gathered and created.

This being was an Aing-Tii guide with no name who resided in the Kathol sector. The creature, acting as if he had been waiting for the Jedi, guided Sigil to the Unknown Regions. How the holocron wound up in the Unknown Region was a mystery, but Sigil was able to locate the ancient temple.

Upon acquiring the holocron, Sigil and his vessel were set upon by a group of dark side cultists, led by a Sith witch named Draeda, underling to Lady Xion.

Laser-fire from the attack craft struck the hyperdrive, damaging it. However, Sigil still risked activated the system as the Aing-Tii creature began to use the Force Power known as Fold Space to remove them from the laser-fire.

The Aing-Tii activated his Force Power and in the inbetween real space and the Folded Space, the hyperdrive activated and exploded. The explosion killed the creature. Sigil's ship is sent out of control, tumbling through hyperspace that appears very different from anything Sigil had seen before. The Jedi slipped in and out of consciousness.

### The Past is my Future

**_3654 BBY_**

Sigil awoke an unknowable amount of time later aboard a humble freighter. It's pilot, a Sullustan unable to speak common, but gesticulating and crudely drawing that he was taking the Jedi back home to the Jedi Temple. Sigil was too injured to argue. The holocron was gripped tightly in his viral hard, with Sigil unable to release the device nor loosen his own fingers from the death grip.

Upon arriving at Coruscant, Sigil was baffled. It was Coruscant and the Temple, but the details were wrong. The statues were different, surrounding buildings were shorter, adornments were not what he remembered. The Jedi themselves were unfamiliar as well.

The medics could find no record of Sigil within their databases. The temple was then shaken by a tremendous force and alarms began to blare. The temple was under attack. A nurse pulled up the security terminal. Sigil could not believe his eyes: Sith were invading the Jedi temple. Exiting the crashed ship behind them stood an imposing figure with an axe headed lightsaber: Darth Malgus.

Sigil's mind reeled. Malgus was a Sith Lord from almost 4,000 years before he was born.

The nurses evacuated Sigil and others, barely escaping the Sith forces. The following weeks played out as the history holo-vids had while Sigil was in school. The Jedi Temple is destroyed, Coruscant held hostage and the Treaty of Coruscant was signed ending the Great War.

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">- - - Work in Progress Below- - -</span>_**

**_3654 BBY - 3640 BBY _**

* Sigil, using his medical knowledged, works as a field medic in the war, greatly enhancing his Force healing capabilities
* Captured by Sith forces just after the Treaty with the Eternal Empire is signed and frozen in carbonite

**_1010 BBY_**

* freed by the Thairyn Rae, sensing the dark side in his virus

**_Sigil Freed by Thairyn Rae (semi-raw data copy/paste between Ed and myself)_**

_Craving more power, young Thairyn is drawn to a relic from the Great Galactic War. It could be an ancient artifact. Maybe a lightsaber or a hidden holocron. Instead he finds an individual frozen in carbonite. Thairyn proceeds to release him from his flash frozen tomb._

_Yea I could see that. Thairyn wouldn't be able to really sense Sigils force energies but he would prolly sense the viruses_

_Works for me. How would Thairyn react to finding out he just released a Jedi?_

_Young Thairyn would be interested in learning how a Jedi with all their knowledge got trapped_

_So he would be interested but also cautious to reveal he is a Sith._

_Sigil would say, to inform Thairyn just as much as piece it together himself, shaking off the hibernation sickness, that he was in battle on Dantooine when he was surrounded by the forces of the Sith. An explosion rocked the building he was in and rubble fell on him, knocking away his lightsaber and crushing part of his body and pinning him in place. The Sith forces found him barely conscious. Seeking to interrogate Sigil, they placed him in carbonite. Sigil inspects himself to see that he has healed completely. Due to the hibernation sickness, his senses are dulled and he pays no attention whether Thairyn is light or dark._

_Thairyn would most likely watch with an interest while asking about the details of the Sith their tactics and ask Sigil how long he's been there_

_Sigil explains some of what he knows, keeping specifics to a minimum, really only explaining basic military strategy. After the question about how long he had been there, a thought crosses Sigil's mind:_

_"I don't... Wait... What year is it?"_

_Thairyn would be sarcastic here and say what year was it when you were frozen?_

_Sigil replies with "(whatever year 3650 BBY translates to)"... slowly coming to the realization that he may have been frozen for far longer than he thinks._

_Thairyn would be shocked and say you have been frozen for 2640 years. Thairyn would really be interested in Sigil being a Jedi now knowing that Jedi from that time period did things differently than the Jedi of the day_

_He would begin asking Sigil why he was frozen, what happened specifically and what was the last thing he remembers_

_After that most likely Thairyn would ask to duel Sigil to see where Thairyn himself stood with his dueling skills_

_So I have the part of the story where Thairyn finally realizes his path was to always become a Jedi. From 125ABY and on until 800ABY Thairyn is constantly using various forms of stasis pods, Carbonite freezing, and force magic to keep himself alive so why not have him meet Sigil during one of his terms as a senator and Sigil realize that Thairyn's dark side aura is gone and it now has begun to shine similar to a Jedi. This also would Cause Thairyn to ask Sigil to be his master_

_Sigil would be in too much shock at how long had passed to tell Thairyn anything about Jedi from the War. He would then, while still in shock, reiterate that he had been a PoW of the Sith Empire. He would flat out refuse to duel at that moment. He is recovering from the sickness but not ready to duel._

_Thairyn would prolly then flip the Sith switch and slam Sigil against the wall laughing and say it's time to play little Jedi!!_

_I am thinking Sigil uses his force powers to keep Thairyn at bay and drive the young Sith off basically gaining Thairyns respect_

_Oh yeah... In his weakened state, Sigil has less control over the virus coursing through him. Thairyn's aggressive action would provoke Sigil's dark side to defensive action. _

_First Sigil would use Force Push to get Thairyn away, slamming him into the far wall, using Push multiple times in succession to batter the young Sith over and over, not harming him so much as dazing him. Next he would dash over, lifting the Sith into the air one handed before instinctively start using Life Drain, with his corrupted arm, to heal himself slightly. A flash of a vision from the Force causes Sigil to abruptly cut off the power  and drop him to the floor and Sigil falls to his knees before saying, "You... you have an odd destiny before you. Leave. Now."_

_Thairyn would leave just because he values his life. Also when Thairyn switches sides his name changes to Ležeran._

_Which helps him to hide his Sith heritage_

* Leezeran withdraws himself and his forces to Chiss space. Sigil could still sense the darkness in the Chiss, however being a Shadow, being an intermediary between the Jedi and galaxy, and what's left of his Senatorial duties, left little time for any direct "hey, stop" interjections

### Return to the Battlefield
> In the fading light of the evening, Sigil stared at the Coruscant skyline, watching the traffic but otherwise lost in thought. Behind him was his personal droid, RU-N3, a small geometric hover-droid. Hanging from its small manipulator appendage hung a reminder of everything that he hated. The backstabbing, doubletalk, manipulation, the heartbreak of losing his mother, and the death, by Sigil's own hands, of his brother Turiel.

> It's just another mission he tried to tell himself. Another time to carry the colors again. Another part of his oath, to himself, to his mother, and to the galaxy. It was time to return to his true vocation. It had been fun, in a way, playing Shadow to Grandmaster Izen, but now there was a new Grandmaster, Yathel-con te D'mori. He will make a fine Grandmaster, however, with the exile of the Order from the Republic, his job will be difficult.

> "Sir, it's time," RU-N3 chirped in its small voice.

> Sigil turned and faced a small case, one of many strewn about the room. He, along with most of the other Jedi in the temple, had packed his belongings, ready for the move to a new world outside of Republic space.

> Into the case Sigil lay his lightsaber and two light-daggers. He smirked as a thought crossed his mind. Many assumed these were his most dangerous weapons. Indeed, Battlemaster Daelan and Grandmaster Izen spent much time boasting of Sigil's abilities as Shadow. While more than capable in such a role, his true power currently hung from RU-N3's manipulator appendage.

> Sigil removed his Jedi robes, folded them and placed them in the case. "Rune, have this case loaded onto the Mahouarashi along with the rest of my Jedi possessions. Then I wish for you to take the ship to the coordinates in the ship's memory. Once there, await my further instructions."

> "Yes sir," the droid replied, dipping singular ocular sensor forward in a mock bow. "And might I add, it has been a pleasure working with you these past few years. Now please get dressed. Miss Nabi is waiting."

> Sigil did as RU-N3 asked. He felt only a little remorse for bringing Nabi along. She was an amazing healer at the temple, one of the best that had stepped through the temple doors. Though now, as Sigil's most recent apprentice, it was time to bring her into the fold of the Shadows. They both had a new battlefield to fight on.

> He briefly thought of his former apprentice, now Master Jedi, Leezeran withdrawing the Chiss and Echani from the Republic. It wasn't a move Sigil would have made, but Leezeran knew how to best serve his own people.

> Finishing adorning his new uniform, every fold perfected, lines and colors creating powerful accents to Sigil's green skin and dark tattoos.

> "How do I look?" he asked the droid.

> RU-N3 tilted on its axis, mocking confusion before answering"...like a senator, sir?"

> Sigil smiled. "Good. Now off to the halls of battle. May the Force have mercy on us all," he spoke to the droid as he exited the room.

> This would be his most difficult mission yet.

Sigil is a male Mirialan with mid-green skin tone and light violet eyes. His hair is black and kept short on the sides and back with the top styled to one side. Tattoos adorn his body. They are styled in the ways of the ancient Sith traditions and intermingled with Mirialan cultural tattoos. He has lived a pampered life since coming to Phiroth, and this shows in his softened physique. Though he still maintains regular light exercise.

Post-time travel:

The War, virus, and time have hardened Sigils features. While still appearing much younger than his true age, lines on his face have deepened, his tattoos have darkened along with his eyes. Sigil's hair, following the time's cultural norms, is much longer now, reaching his shoulders but kept in a topknot with the sides and back shaved. The color is now faded at the ends but remains dark at the roots. Many battles have strengthened his body and scars now misalign and gap some of his tattoos.

**Infection**

Pre-Mortis:

Due to the nature of the Scar Virus, Sigil must keep his healing abilities focused on keeping the virus from overtaking his body. His left arm constantly emits Dark Side energy and should Sigil ever drop his healing power, the virus would, over a matter of days, spread through the rest of his body, corrupting him wholly. Due to his infected arm, Sigil sleeps very little and replenishes himself through meditation and Serenity Trances taught to him by the Jedi Order upon his return.

Post-Mortis:

The beings that inhabit the Force world of Mortis 'freed' Sigil of the virus plaguing his body, rendering it inert. However the tissue disfigurement remains.

## Powers and Abilities

Pre-Mortis:

Sigil had to constantly use the Force to fight off the Sith Virus. Sigil would be much stronger in applicable Force if it were not for this. Medics could do nothing as his and Tu’riel’s cells are genetically the same, allowing the virus to easily spread throughout his body. Conversely, if Sigil were to use powers that draw upon the Dark Side, they would be amplified immensely.

Post-Mortis:

Sigil no longer must divide his attention to keep the virus at bay. His Force related abilities have expanded dramatically.
