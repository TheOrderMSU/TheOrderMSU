## Introduction

Aeryn Thall [(Mugen)](link) is a fallen Jedi who’s presence in the force is muted for much of his existence. His early life was riddled with conflict that influenced his initial fall. His most noted accomplishment is his ascension to the rank of Mandalore, the leader of the cultural sect he originated from. His rule was seen as a massive rebuilding of the sect itself back to its former glory as well as a military force throughout the galaxy. He is a prominent member in the Aravaxian Brotherhood, receiving training from Aravax, Vehx, and Ashkya before focusing on honing his abilities in solitude.

His biggest contribution to the Force was his development of his Teras Kasi form, taking several basic concepts to make a highly destructive variation of the more pin-point calculated form used by the Miraluka. It is this hand to hand combat was how he managed to become leader of the scattered Mandalorian tribes and eventual Mandalore. His later life was spent in meditation in the force, recovering several key holocrons to enhance his understanding of it. Through his studies he gained a newer perspective, one of understanding of the Force as a whole instead from either the light or dark side which influenced the remaining years of his life as well as teachings.

### Once a Jedi

On the inner edge of the Outer Rim of the Galaxy a war had come to a very brutal end for almost everyone involved.  Hit worst were perhaps the Mandalorian people who were left splintered and fractured across many of their territories, some left enslaved to their enemies, and others barely clinging to survival.  Mandalore itself was fractured, most if not all of the primary families that made up the upper ring of dignitaries and generals were completely wiped out leaving a bitter victory over the Sith of the time.

One year following the devastation a search party from the Jedi sought to comb the planet of Mandalore for artifacts and other relics that may still remain despite the destruction.  By chance they encountered a sect of women, children, and elders who managed to make it through the calamity and survive with limited resources.  Among them was a young child, no more than a year old who’s small tufts of hair shown in vibrant shades of blue, green, yellow seemingly random.  It was obvious to the Jedi that this child was certainly connected to the force in a way none of his peers were, and with ease, given his orphanage, he was to return with them to the Jedi homeworld.

Growing up within the Jedi proved to be far more difficult than one would think, without a name, addressed solely by his race.  Despite their beliefs the young Mandalorian was constantly reminded of who he was and how his inclusion would result in nothing but catastrophe.  These musings from the other children were understandable, he looked different, he was built stronger, he was more competitive, and in all it made it difficult for him to fit in.  The point that made the biggest negative impression was when the older jedi also began treating him differently, predisposed to treat him negatively and hold him to impossible standards.  When his force abilities were lacking he would be punished while others were given positive criticism, when he showed aggression in team exercises he was scolded.

One of the few of his peers that didn’t constantly berate became one of his closest friends and confidants, a Miraluka by the name of Daelan, a friendship that helped keep the young Mandalorian stable even when he was paired with an incompetent Jedi Knight, Aequitas, who was sub-par for the course.  He consistently would have to keep his master from getting himself killed and would only be thanked with more brutal punishments.  Soon after one of these missions he was approached by a Gungan Knight by the name of Tecnic and began training in secrecy, finally giving him the approval from an authority figure, and more importantly, an actual name that wasn’t a constant reminder that he would never be accepted by the Jedi, Aeryn.

Things continued on, his hindrance at the side of Aequitas, his advancement with Tecnic, and his friendship with Daelan, until a fateful encounter on a mission when he encountered the Dark Lord Aravax and his small band of Sith, UnnValdr, and Vehx.  After a brief encounter and duel that almost saw the Knight butchered with ease, Aeryn was subdued by Aravax and UnnValdr who left him with a single statement, “find us.”  The interaction would bathe the Mandalorian in doubt as to his place within the Jedi Order, a seed that would slowly grow as he himself became more and more powerful.

Everything came to a head one night when training with Tecnic when the jedi pressed him about his dependence on aggression in battle instead of the passive role Jedi were meant to take.  This lead to a grazing attack that removed the Gungan’s ear, and would be an obvious indication that Tecnic had taken someone on as an apprentice.  Shortly after Aeryn found himself standing before the council being judged for his aggression against another jedi.  Found guilty he was to be returned to youngling training, which was the last straw.

Aeryn gathered what few possessions he had, loaded himself into Aequitas’s ship and set off into the galaxy to follow the instructions given to him by Lord Aravax.



### The Descent into Darkness

The travels were difficult as Aeryn lacked a proper way to gather credits beyond general merc work or hard labor, neither of which sat right with him, but they allowed him to search various planets for information regarding Aravax and his band.  All the while, still hiding from the Jedi who had begun to use him as basic missions for Knights to bring back or execute a target.  At first Aeryn struggled to get away, running more than fighting, his skills were definitely lacking in comparison, but with each passing encounter he improved.  As time went on fewer and fewer jedi would be able to make it back to their order, either killed outright or too wounded to make a timely return.

Aeryn blazed a trail taking him to the Outer Rim, where he was finally able to track down Lord Aravax and join his ranks, instructed by a half-Zabarak named Ashkya.  Under her teaching Aeryn gained a sort of family, something he didn’t have up to that point, and despite the rigorous teaching methods enjoyed himself while he grew in power.

During his training, the sect of Sith would travel throughout the Outer Rim, training their powers, looting crypts of old Sith, and learned far more about the force than was spoken of in the Jedi Order.  Sometime into these excursions Aeryn was tracked down by Daelan, fearing that he would have to strike down his friend he prepared for battle but was surprised when Daelan only expressed a desire to make sure Aeryn was alive.  The meeting allowed the two to rekindle their friendship and maintain contact.  Along with Daelan, Aeryn met Abyssus, a sort of anomaly in Aeryn’s mind as far as where he stood with the force, but he let it go, seeing as he was under Daelan’s tutelage.  After the brief meeting the two parted ways, but kept in contact, Aeryn feeding information based off their movements and Daelan warning Aeryn of areas the Jedi were present it as to prevent them from encountering each other.

Soon after Aeryn surpassed Ashkya in his training, and begun training alongside her under Vehx up to becoming Lord Mugen.

### Gathering What Was Once Shattered

After many adventures with the Aravaxian Brotherhood and several instances that resulted in Aravax’s disappearance the group fell apart.  UnnValdr made several attempts to bring back the Dark Lord, but even his powers had a limit.  After these trials Vehx disappeared leaving only Mugen and Ashkya, the two parting ways onto their own ambitions.

Mugen travelled to Kashyyyk, to hide more from the Jedi Order and to hone his physical abilities and continue to form his martial form that he began while training with Vehx.  While on the planet Mugen encountered a Trandoshan warrior by the name of Sturg Draco’Deus, who was locked into a heated battle with a group of wookies.  The warrior was obviously force sensitive and appeared to be similar to the Mandalorian due to their backgrounds.  After formalities Deus found himself under Mugen’s wing, and immediately began training.  While in training Mugen perfected his hand to hand combat method assisted by the local wookies despite the presence of their rival race being present.  It was during this time that he met G’unthro, a rather strong wookie who almost bested Mugen, but fell short due to his lack of stamina, the creature was strong in the force but lacked formal training.  Though he would have liked to take on the wookie as a student he believed it would be disrespectful to his primary student.

After years of training Deus proved to be a powerful warrior but also an excellent strategist, and a drive to liberate his people and their home.  It was at this time Mugen began to wonder about his own, he knew they were fractured, and he knew a small bit about their culture, perhaps he could unite them as well, but first he would see to the Trandoshan liberation, his would have to come later.  While on conquest in the Kashyyyk star system Deus and Mugen amassed a sizable army of Trandoshan warrirors, led by Deus, somewhat advised by Mugen.

During one of the skirmishes they happened upon a small village of fifty humans, waving the sigils of the Mandalorians.  Their leader appeared strong physically but lacked the drive to go further which left the village to stagnate.  Abiding to the old laws of the Mandalorians, Mugen challenged the leader to hand to hand combat, a fight, made incredibly easy given his mastery of Teras Kasi.  He was named chief, and the entirety of the village loaded up and left the planet with the Trandoshans.

A couple years passed, more Trandoshans were amassed, large enough to contend with those in control of Trandosha, and a supporting army consisting of fifteen Mandalorian tribes.  With the combined efforts of Deus, Mugen, and their respective armies they seized Trandosha back and freed those remaining in bondage.  At this time Mugen and Deus formed a blood pact between their races, Mugen becoming Dosh and Deus becoming Mandalorian, uniting the two cultures for some time.

## Personality and Traits

### Appearance and Outfit:

Aeryn is an exceptionally fit specimen, having a large stature that served him well during his time as an active member of multiple Sith Brotherhoods, as well as active battle in the rebuilding of the Mandalorian army.  On his right eye is the symbol of the exploding star, a remnant of a long dead Sith Brotherhood.  His hair varies heavily depending on different points in his life and his control over his defining emotion, mostly being shades of red, black, and eventually, white.

Mugen wore the attire of a sith apprentice until he liberated Mandalore for his people and was given his own set of Mandalorian Armor.  Since then he is never seen without his armor, only wearing the iconic helmet in official ceremonies.

Once he achieves one-ness with the force, Mugen's appearance shifts heavily, less of a focus on his physical body, allowing it to fault slightly, and his hair to grow long and unkept.

Aeryn's physical abilities are second to none, his complete repertoire of all known saber styles, his development and expansion of Teras Kasi, and his control over his body and the force within it make him an incredibly dangerous combatant.  His other force abilities, while lacking, are still enough to hold his own against other force users.

### Behind the Scenes

Mugen's backstory has been a large labor of love, having spanning nearly 6 years in the order, it is difficult to stream together one coherent timeline for him, especially given everything I have done in his portrayal. I've had 2 side changes, five masters, two apprentices (one being a former master), mastering all 7 forms, and even laying the groundwork for Teras Kasi and assisting with the RP system.  Mugen's base appearance is based solely on that of myself (Jesse) when I first started college, the idea of his changing hair color, is derived again from my first year of college, when I dyed my mohawk upwards to 4 different colors and it fading to various shades of the 4.  I am always open to adding more to Mugen's backstory or even making connections with others, let me know and I'll see if we can make it work!

Aeryn Thall is played by Jesse Webb-Greenhill.
