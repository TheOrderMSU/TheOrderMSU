## Introduction

Brief introduction to Padawan.

### Childhood/ Training/ Rise to Mastery

Izen was born on Dorin, the home planet for the Kel-Dor. Being born with silver eyes, he was immediately noticed as a force sensitive. As such, he was taken away from his parents at the age of 5 to start training for the Baran Do sages. At this time, he abandoned his last name, as to not tie him to any prestige of his late family. After 3 intensive years of non-stop training, Izen was finally inducted into the sages order. With the natural talents of the force, Izen dedicated himself to learning every martial art, and every weapon style available to the Sages. After 2 years, and a few promotions within the Baran Do sages, Izen was found by the Jedi council. He had apparently been releasing a large amount of force during training, acting as a beacon to those of even slight force sensitivity. The Jedi council explain to the Kel-Dor, that Izen was acting as a beacon, which would more than likely attract unwanted trouble from the Sith. The Baron-Do sages reluctantly gave Izen up, realizing it would be better for him to mature in the force, and for their race to live peacefully.

Izen began training immediately when they arrived back on Coruscant. Being slightly older than most at the academy, Izen was at a larger disadvantage, which kept him behind in studies. After a few years of training however, Izen caught up, and surpassed his fellow padawans in the art of saber combat. With such a difference in power, Izen was first taken up by his Human Jedi Master Vice. Vice trained Izen for a solid year, teaching him the advanced aspects of the lightsaber forms that eluded him up until then while traveling across the galaxy for different missions. The two had spent long hours completing mission, and training for hours uncounted. After Izen had fully bonded with Vice, Izen's master took on a solo mission that he would never return from. Not sure how to keep his emotions in check, Izen turned to the use of the force in combat, hoping to release some of the feelings he had for his master's disappearance. Izen Trained hard and once again started to outperform his other padawans.

Like before, the prowess in the techniques came naturally due to the Baran Do training, and once again he was noticed. This time Master Arceus had noticed him. Arceus was a Jedi Master that kept to himself, and felt no strong ties to any of the other masters. Arceus helped Izen perfect the force training, and tried to get Izen to start training with his lightsaber again. Reluctant, Izen starting practicing his lightsaber techniques with Arceus, who saw flaws in his form and helped him overcome them. After over a year, Izen was once again at the top of his class. One day, Arceus came to him with news that he might leave in order to assist The Council on a mission that required him to be away from the academy for a great deal of time. Before Izen could detest, Arceus stopped him and informed him that his goal was to get Izen To knight before he left. Izen agreed, and the two of them began to practice almost double the time of the other apprentices and padawans. As promised, Izen obtained his knighthood before Arceus left, and gave his farewells to his Master before he left. After obtaining his knighthood, Izen Trained continuously for a couple of years until his techniques could no longer be refined. After much deliberation, The council had agreed to let him take his trial of mastery in the upcoming months.

Izen had been training so hard, he had little conversation with the other fellow Jedi. After slowing down his training, and focusing on more of the people around his, Izen noticed another Jedi raising through the ranks far quicker then he had. The Jedi was a Gungun with mechanical legs. He was odd, but very talented. Izen soon found out this man's name was Technik. Technik eventually found his way to Izen, as he had been training with all the rising Jedi, working to improve his techniques. Technik challenged Izen to a duel, which of course, Izen couldn't decline. Throughout the duel, Izen and Technik were on equal footing. Each of the two had particular strengths and weaknesses that seemed to complement each others style, but as one would go in for the kill, the other would defend at the last second. Izen felt the two would have been exactly of equal technique if it hadn't been for Technik's flawless defense. No matter how advanced Izen maneuvers became, Technik's defenses were always one step ahead. After a grueling duel that lasted almost thirty minutes, the two Jedi stopped and collapsed to the ground. They each congratulated each other than went their separate ways. Izen was floored. Up to this point he had absolutely no trouble dealing with Jedi since he at least became a knight. A couple of weeks later, Izen was informed that Technik had taken the master trial and had passed with flying colors.

Suddenly, Izen was filled with disappointment with himself. He had become lazy, and had no drive. To watch someone so quickly rise through the ranks, he felt he had let down his previous Masters. Izen, wrought with disappointment, entered a week long trance to find his drive. There was something now Master Technik had, that Izen didn't. Izen didn't really have anything to prove, besides the pride of his people, and the legacy of the Baran Do sages. After his week-long trance, Izen hadn't discovered anything new. Nothing had changed, and he still hadn't found a reason to push himself stronger. Sure he considered Technik somewhat of a rival, but the race was finished to master, what was the point for his to hurry and reach Master second. His mind gouged his pride, constantly thinking of how the other Jedi each had their own baggage that carried them to the rank of Master. Izen became infuriated with himself. He really didn't have responsibilities, or pressures growing up. His planet was fine, great actually. He had obtained a great deal of knowledge from the academy's data banks, and had learned many new techniques. His initial quest was over. The only obligation now was to stay at the academy to keep Dorin safe from the Sith detecting his presence. Izen felt that this frustration was coming to a boil and needed to release it.

Walking out to the training fields late in the day was relaxing. No one else was there. Just the small whistle of the wind blowing through the open windows filled the large room as Izen walked in. His pent up feelings were almost clawing their way through his skull as his frustration peaked. Almost immediately as he stepped onto the mat, Izen in a thoughtless action simultaneously ignited his saber, and threw it at one of the training dummies in the middle of the room. A bright flash of orange wrapped itself continuously around the dummy as the blade struck it multiple times. Before the blade fully returned to Izen, the Jedi leaped into the air, catching the blade and fell through with a devastating downward strike. As his first strike hit, Izen just released his inhibitions, and starting to attack the dummy in a fury. As he did, he felt his mind calm, yet his attacks never let up. He was attacking the dummy in a frenzy, far more aggressive than he had ever seen a Jedi do previous, and this was far more Sith-like. Izen stopped his attack, and dis-ignited his lightsaber. As he did so, a Jedi master had walked into the room. Izen didn't recognize this Master, so he assumed he must have just come in from a mission, or had been new. The Master looked at Izen worriedly, then shifted his eyes to the now smoking dummy. The dummies were reinforced with materials to resist lightsabers, but Izen's attacks had damaged the protection anyways. The dummies weren't made for that kind of onslaught. Even the Jedi Guardians weren't trying to destroy them. Their attacks were far more pulled. The Master rushed to the dummy to examine it, then turned to Izen. With a scowl the Master quietly left the room. Izen knew he was going to be in trouble for this. He had tapped a power far more dangerous than he had ever experienced. Surprisingly, he wasn't frightened, not even shaking. Normally something like that would shake someone up, but Izen felt completely in control. He had used his frustration to fuel his attack, but had a chain on his emotions at the same time. He now understood why the Jedi wouldn't allow this teaching. It was dangerous, but very powerful. Izen knew he was going to have to address the council, but now he had a backing. He wanted to use this power, with control. he wanted to prove to the masters this wasn't only an art of the Sith, but only the most critical of Jedi. Izen now had his drive.

Luckily the council was off planet. Izen found out that the Master that had seen him after his aggressive training session was just a Master from off-world that had came to basically babysit the younglings. Izen had only a couple of weeks to train in order tom improve himself. He did know he was dealing with a dangerous power, that despite how much he trained, he was still going to be scrutinized. After about a week of intense training during the day, and his more secretive training at night, Izen was a little exhausted. Izen also had heard that Master Technik had picked up an apprentice. A young Miralukan by the name of Daelan. Izen was a bit envious that Technik had already acquired an apprentice, but it was something he could deal with later. He was quickly running out of time to improve his technique for his trial. Just as he thought, all of the temple's masters arrived within the next week and had given Izen his trial date.

Izen gave it his all during his Master Trial. At first it was the basic necessities that were required for the base trial. He had mastered the combat of facing multiple opponents, but his Ataru wasn't very strong. He had been so focused on mastering his emotions in combat, that he had gotten quite rusty with his Forms. During the trial, Izen let his emotions slip a bit too often with Ataru, making the form change into a sloppy, unrefined form. The Masters were quite upset, and shocked to see Izen fail his form training. The council also warned Izen of his emotions, which led to his explanation of the ideal, and the use. The council was barely moved by his insight, only brushing it off. They told him that too many have walked this path, which only leads to ruin. This of course aggravated Izen, but at the same time built on his drive to prove them wrong. Leaving the trial defeated, Izen felt ashamed of his failures, but motivated to fix his mistakes and train. Izen was quickly assigned a mission later that evening which was off-world. This would be his first mission off-world solo. He quickly accepted and left.

The mission was an easy one; just investigate some ruins that were suspected of occult activity. The location was actually Dxun, the largest moon of Onderon. The mission was simple enough, and Izen had no problems whatsoever camping out by the ruins for a couple of weeks to take watch. As Izen started towards his ship to leave Dxun, a large Zakkeg ambushed him from an overhang. Izen quickly avoided the animal, but before he could attack the animal, a human sized shadow jumped from the trees and landed on the creature's head. Izen thought he heard the ignition of a lightsaber, but no blade protruded from the now deceased animal's head. As the creature fell to the ground, the figured removed the weapon from the creature, revealing a small dagger-shaped lightsaber. Izen was intrigued, as the only short blades he had seen were that of a shoto-saber, which were nearly half the size of a normal blade. The figure turned towards Izen revealing a male human. Izen greeted him, with alarming apprehension. He had been taught that anyone wielding a lightsaber out of the Jedi Order was to be considered dangerous. The person greeted Izen back with a happy and excited voice. Izen's sensing powers were quite weak, but he still had the abilities to detect any hostile feelings, but none were sensed. Izen dropped his guard a little and started to discuss with the man. Izen found out later, that the man was named Xavara, and was a Jedi that had left the temple to learn on his own. Izen was still very curious about the dagger style, and inquired upon it. Xavara gave Izen in depth detail of the form, and how it was used, giving him only one warning: with great speed, comes little defense. Izen was highly excited to learn a new weapon style, and asked how it was built. After some explaining, Izen understood well the idea of the form. After a few hours of the teaching, Xavara informed Izen that he needed to get back to his camp before the beasts came out at night, and the Izen should leave if he were leaving tonight. Izen bid farewell to his new friend and Left for Coruscant.

After reporting in, Izen left the academy to acquire some parts for his new dagger saber that he was to build. He needed one to practice the style, and as far as he knew, nothing in the ruled of the temple or coded forbade him from using it. After a couple of trips into the marketplace, and the temple's repair stock, Izen acquired all the parts needed. After a short ritual to put the weapon together, Izen had made his first blade. He checked to see if it worked, igniting the beautiful ice blue. The color seemed to oppose, but work with his current saber Yume Sukai, which was orange. Izen then trained tirelessly for the next couple of weeks, working with his two blades, while also bettering his Ataru. Izen concentrated on controlling his emotions for his styles, letting his emotions weave in and out of his blade-work. After close to three months after his last trial, Izen felt he was ready to trial again. After asking the Masters for a trial date, they informed him that an Elder was to be at the temple for the next few weeks, and was going to sit in on his trial. Izen was excited, but very nervous. The Master they were talking about was Ordo, whose elder style was Ataru. Izen had almost a week until his trial so he decided he need to continue his mastery of Ataru.
