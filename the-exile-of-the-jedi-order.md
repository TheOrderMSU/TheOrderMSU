After the extensive War of the Storms and destruction wrought by the Fallen in its wake, The Republic blames the Jedi for failing in their duties of protection. The Republic Senate is full of heated debates.

Grandmaster Izen appoints Yathel as the new Grandmaster of the Jedi Order.

Jedi Battlemaster Daelan and Force Witch Xion engage in a blood duel on the planet Dosha under the watchful gaze of Darth Deus. Many Jedi were also present, all attempting to hide from each other. Izne, Yathel, Sigil, and others were present to witness the spectacle. Daelen wins the duel, presumably killing Xion. The Witch lived thanks to a dark side concoction of her own creation, but not before being skinned by the Trandoshand Dark Lord Deus, claiming another trophy.

The exiled Jedi remove themselves to Unknown Space, settling on the planet Volik. Here, under the gudiance of new Jedi Grandmaster Yathel, the Jedi beging to build a new temple. It takes two years to complete.

During this time Darth Deus sees an opportunity to seize power. Interrupting a Senate session, the Dark Lord of the Sith makes bold declarations of the Jedi's failure, and the Senate's as well. Deus' troops then invade the Senate hall and open fire upon those that have failed to accept Deus. A majority of the Republic Senators lay dead.

Also seeing an opportunity to reclaim the former glories, the Banking Clans and the Trade Federation through their significant resources behind Deus.

This is a time of rebuilding for all. Deus rebuilds the Republic in his image. The Jedi rebuild their order far from the eyes of the Sith. Many new Jedi and Sith emerge during this time.
