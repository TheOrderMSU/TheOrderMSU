# Writing Style

- This wiki uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for styling. https://www.markdownguide.org/
- A template article written in Markdown may be found here: https://github.com/TheOrderMSU/TheOrderMSU/blob/gh-pages/bio-template.md
- Please keep your articles as Third Person. Small segments of First Person can be allowable to help set tone. These should be kept brief however.
- Try to break your article into multiple headings rather than one long wall of text. This helps to keep sections concise and automatically (with proper Markdown) creates links to those sections.

As the Order is university group, a certain amount of writing ability is expected. Please use complete sentences, correct spelling, punctuation, and proper paragraphs.

If you need assistance, there are many people who will gladly lend the assistance with editing.
