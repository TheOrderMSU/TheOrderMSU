## Introduction

“UnnValdr” [was] the central connecting factor of the Order of the Force. Found in Cryo stasis, UnnValdr was subjected to genetic modification as a vessel for “Andeddu”. This gives him the ability to regenerate and an indefinite lifespan. He however escapes and is picked up by merchants and traders. They teach him their way of living, and give him a place amongst them. In “1025 BBY” he crashes onto”Despayre” and meets another victim of the experiment, a Force sensitive named “Thel-Ehud” who becomes like a brother to him. After they escape, they are taken in by Jedi Master “Xemnas” and trained by the Jedi Order under the leadership of “Grandmaster Lucian”.Because of the difficulty dealing with the pain of not being able to do and the growing number of questions, UnnValdr begins falling prey to his emotions, and in “995 BBY”, is converted to the Dark Side by “Dark Lord of the Sith Aravax”. Once he has converted he begins seeking answers to his many questions and before becoming a Lord himself, manages to find some of them and giving him his primary goal, to get revenge for the destruction of his race that was destroyed over 25,000 years ago.

Once he acquired Lordship, he took on a young man by the name of “Vehx” as his first apprentice. Vehx would become one of what would be later known as the “Dark Lineage”, those trained by the methods of Aravax.

In “982 BBY”, UnnValdr takes on his second apprentice, youngest sister of “Lady Shioni”, named “Tenshioni” whilst her sister left on a mission with Sith Lord, “Sham-Riku”. Tenshioni however, only remained under Unn’s guidance until they returned in which her training was taken over by Lady Shioni.

Shortly after that he met the only other member of his race still alive, though mysteriously unable to age without being genetically modified. The young girl would grow very close to UnnValdr, and he would give her a new name, “Epora”, meaning ”fortune” in their original language. She would change his outlook on life, and would bring his plans in a new direction-the eventual resurrection of his long forgotten race.

For the next couple hundred years he would meet many users of both Light and Dark Side powers, and using an ability he developed called Tethering, would one day be able to revive them.

### From Birth to Battle

In “1048” BBY a group of scientists stumbled across the cryo-capsule of a young humanoid boy. Seeing no difference in him from other humanoid species they decided he would be of good use as a test subject for genetic experimentation in creating a vessel for “Andeddu”. Because of the nature of his race’s force abilities, his body managed to survive the process and as far as they were concerned, he was a successful experiment that simply needed evaluation to ensure they could repeat the process. However, late one night the induced coma that he had been constantly kept under, began to wear off as a result of cellular adaptation. As he awoke from his stasis in a container of amniotic fluid he panicked and busted out using bursts of force energy. Confused and disoriented he ran through the halls of the facility, setting off alarm after alarm, being chased by the scientists and guards stationed throughout. The chase led onto a large landing deck with nowhere to go but over the edge into a violent ocean. Scared and still disoriented, “UnnValdr” attempted to follow the ledge until he lost his footing and falling into the water, where he was quickly pulled under by the heavy current. For days UnnValdr would suffer the misery of not being able to breath or control his movements as the waters swept him miles from the facility, yet at the same time not dying as his cells began to slow down their metabolic rate as to retain their energy and would still regenerate faster than they would die off. Nearly a week after this torment, he drifted into calm waters where a large ship full of traders rescued him thinking him a visitor who had crashed landed in one of the storms.

Having no memory of his former life or anything before awakening in the tank, aside from his name, Unn had no choice but to accompany the traders for a time. With them he would learn to make a living as well develop his nomadic lifestyle. It was with them over a span of 23 years that he began learning of his force powers, applying them to his trade by sensing whether another trader was trying to lie or swindle him. He would assist in the movement of large loads as well as developing excellent piloting skills. Many force users became weary of his most unusual and almost unnatural ability, the ability to appear ‘Force Neutral’ though not by negating the force but by having control over the force enough to hide within it, leaving no trace of existence, in time or space. This concerned many of them who would report to the council of the time that they feared one like this becoming a “Sith” would mean certain doom for the Galaxy. However, the council viewed these reports as mere myths and legends passed down through the traders and merchants. Within a matter of time he would learn of the extent of his regenerative ability after a meteor storm crashed his ship on the prison planet “Despayre”. His body horribly mangled and burned, he believed it would be the end for him, until he noticed himself literally regrowing from his torso. Once regenerated he had no scars, no weakened bones, no tissue damage, whatsoever. However he was still weak from the stress of his first major regeneration and was quickly captured and forced into slavery. It was here he met a boy named “Thel-Ehud” who had just arrived there.

> ”He appeared as if a ghost to a normal man. I could not sense him, nor could have I forseen him.”
>
> – Master Thel-Ehud recounting his escape from Despayre to the Jedi younglings.

They quickly became like brothers, especially as Unn learned that Thel had similar origins, being created off of the research originally done on UnnValdr. He also learned that Thel had escaped as well and fought with all his power to escape, having control over his force powers from his awakening.

After serving a couple of years, the two began to conspire to escape. Because of density of life on the planet, any guards that were force sensitive could not keep track of Unn, allowing him to catch them off guard and break from his cell. Then he proceeded to free Thel-Ehud. As they are discovered, they began a coupe de’ tat by releasing other prisoners to ensure enough chaos to keep the guards busy. The duo fought their way to a hanger where they manage to steal a ship to escape with.

Over the next 20 years the two continued their training, traveling from planet to planet. Engaging in trading as a way to make a living and to fuel their ship. In 1003 BBY, a Jedi Master by the name of “Xemnas”, met with the two during one of their stops to trade goods. Sensing the calm of Thel, and though at first showing concern for Unn’s Force absence, trusted in Thel’s judgment of him and offered to take them to see the council to become Jedi.

Within 3 years’ time the two became Jedi Knights. Accelerating through the ranks. However Unn’s Force absence made the council weary of promoting him to Master, now knowing that the legends were true, and more peculiar his lack of aging. Though Thel-Ehud had matured to the same point, he had his age to reflect that appearance.

Soon, Unn would become burdened by ever growing questions that for years seemed minuscule. “Who am I? Where am I from? Why am I like this?” He began to vanish for long periods of time into the archives, studying and researching. In many missions he would reserve mortal wounds that burned with intense pain, only to recover within minutes. He began to despise living, and feeling the pain of dying without being able to do so. After 5 years, he began to uncover old manuscripts that talk of an ancient race that could appear as ‘shells’ to force users. A people that seemed to exist and yet not. Unn became obsessed with these excerpts, and eventually left the Jedi Temple to seek answers. This became a grave concern for the Council, now heeding the words of the Jedi who came before them with the fears of a Sith who could hide in the force, decades ago.

### “995-990 BBY”
Seeking answers, Unn eventually crosses paths with the “Dark Lord Aravax” who had recently gained Lord status from his teacher, “Darth Bane”. Aravax was mesmerized by Unn’s ability to hide in the force and even though he could not sense his feelings, Aravax could see the look in Unn’s eyes that reflected his confusion and need for a purpose. Unn then realized that maybe it was power that he needed to fuel his purpose, that he couldn’t find answers without it and began training under Aravax as his apprentice.

Once converted, Aravax led an assault on a group of Jedi that included Thel-Ehud. Seeing UnnValdr on the dark side drove a wedge between the two friends. Though neither one would bring themselves to harm the other, they could never again see themselves as allies. The two clashed in an epic battle that fueled Aravax’s own lust for power bringing him into the fight. Eventually causing Thel-Ehud to abandon the fight and flee. It seemed like UnnValdr was a slave to the Dark Side after all.

However, as Unn became stronger he began seeking the answers he originally came to the dark side for. His ability to see using his cognitive abilities exponentialized, taking him once more on lone excursions.

Shortly before reaching his Lordship, Unn stumbles across a set of Ruins that appeared to him in a dream. The planet was desolate, battered with craters and wore signs of many ancient battles. The air was barely breathable and visibility on the surface was minimal at best. Here he began to find his answers. There he found this mural.

>”Stories told of an ancient race, advanced but not slaves to their technology. A very religious people who believed in battles of strength but not murder. They were like shells in the force, existing but never able to appear in the cognition of the Force sensitive. Feared by them, a group from amongst Tython felt it necessary to ensure that no user of Bogan could arise from them and that the utter destruction of their race was the one and only solution. They hailed from the stars like the indignation of heaven, bringing mercenaries and soldiers alike, all swayed by their mystic tongues to annihilate all on that world. Their warriors were strong and fought with intensity to protect their sphere, only to be overwhelmed by the ‘men that outnumbered the stars’. As they stood over the burning world, the 20,000 that commanded this vast army roared aloud “Let us remember why we did this! Let us never again allow this kind of power to rise again. To protect the galaxy, the universe and beyond from Bogan”. They for many generations would continue to wait for the rumors to touch their ears so they may someday rise again to quell that power from existence. Even after their exile from Tython by the Je’daii, they remained watching and this mural is to serve as a memory to those lives lost and a warning to those like them in the future.”

UnnValdr would return to his training and acquire his Lordship under Aravax. It was from there that his purpose began.
Once he acquired Lordship Unn began training his force powers to control objects at the molecular level, slowly learning to control the effects of his regeneration. This would be the key ability in Unn’s plans.

In “984 BBY”, UnnValdr met with the Force sensitive young man by the name of “Vehx”. Being perplexed by this strange power as many others have, UnnValdr was able to successfully convert him to the Dark Side. This would UnnValdr’s first apprentice. In “982 BBY”, fellow Sith, “Lady Shioni”, would leave on a mission with Sith Lord “Sham-Riku”, leaving her younger sister in the care of Sith Lord UnnValdr, to begin her training. Her name was “Tenshioni” and is considered Unn’s second apprentice. However after only a year of training, the two high-ranking Sith returned and Tenshioni’s training was to resume under Shioni’s hands.

The biggest change to UnnValdr however, would occur with the meeting of a young girl who had no name. He could not sense her in the Force and could not see her through cognitive abilities. This immediately challenged everything he thought he knew of his race, the very fact that they were extinct and he was all there was left. The two grew very close, and UnnValdr took her under his wing during his training of Vex, showing her the ways of the force, though not just the dark side as he had been with his apprentice. He also gave her a name he felt suited his feelings for her, “Epora” meaning fortune; a name from his native tongue, one of few that he could recall. She was very mysterious and seemed to draw his purely selfish nature away and replace it with passion and insight. Yet he still remained loyal to the dark side of the force, eventually guiding Vex to his Lordship.

In “980 BBY”, there was a confrontation between the Sith of the “Aravaxian brotherhood” and the “Jedi Order of Grandmaster Lucian”. UnnValdr would meet “Jedi Master Izen” and upon a premonition would tether his ‘soul’ using an ability he had developed in “985 BBY” and inform him of a time that he may need to call on him for a purpose that even a devout Jedi could see as honorable and necessary.

After these years, Unn leaves to train his mind and body with Epora to prepare himself for the day he sets his plans into motion.

### Allies Forever

UnnValdr made many alliances over the years, all of which were to be included in his goal to seek and annihilate the secret organization of force users that stand watch in order to ensure a race like his does not re-arise. He successfully tethers to each and every one with the intent to revive every one of them once the time arrives.

Unnvaldr steadily ranks his way up to one of Aravax’s top Sith Lords and granted title of Elder during the remainder of Aravax’s life. In the last days of his life, UnnValdr approaches him and reveals his plans. Seeing it as a chance for immortality and power, he accepts and allows Unn to tether him.

In between training sessions, UnnValdr begins meeting with her and over time, the two grow very close. She eventually becomes a constant companion to the trio, leaving the planet she had been on and called home for so long. She explains to Unn that she has actually been alive for so long that she no longer remembers her age and her past, even her very name. Feeling she should have a purpose and an identity, UnnValdr gives her the name Epora.

### Personality and Traits

> "You could have not known he was a Sith except for the burning gleam for revenge in his eyes, for his love for his allies rivaled even that of the most honorable Jedi."
>
> Jedi Master Vacia, following the near defeat of the Aravaxian brotherhood against the Jedi Order of Grandmaster Lucian in 986 BBY.


### Powers and Abilities

“Force camouflage”: The ability to control the way force flows around and through himself, preventing other Force Users from seeing Unn in their premonitions and from sensing his presence. Only the basic 5 senses can be used to track him. This ability is naturally occurring amongst his race, stemming from a certain kind of control that they had adapted over time.

“Rapid Cellular Regeneration”: As long as a single cell is left, UnnValdr can regenerate from it at a very quick pace. His pain receptors do not completely grow use to pain as most other’s would, and as a side effect is hard on Unn’s psyche as in the occurrence such as drowning, he would not die, but would suffer the pain of suffocation until he is able to breathe again. This ability was genetically engineered into him as part of a secret project to create a vessel for Andeddu’s consciousness.

“Standard Force manipulation”: This includes Force push, strangles, and telekinesis. Also used to build lightsabers, or other forms of technology.

“Force sensing and Force premonitions”

“Force tethering”: This ability allows Unn to store a copy of anyone’s DNA and link’s there to ‘Soul’ or Force presence to it. This is primarily so Unn can replicate their body and revive them by reattaching their life force to the new body, he can also modify their DNA to improve their new bodies.

“Force lightning and Force Storms”

“Force Charging”: Unn gain’s the ability after nearly 1000 years of accumulating Force energy to actually charge Force Crystals inside of his body.

“Fusion”: Combining his Force control and his Cellular regeneration, he can fuse his body, mind, and soul with another willing individual, combining the Force abilities of both.

“Creation”: By using an immense amount of Force energy and Force control, UnnValdr can accomplish the one thing that Plu-Koon wanted to do, create. This is only used once, to recreate a planet for his ancestors to live on and fills it with living things, as it usually destroys the body from the violent nature that the energy leaves the body.

### Behind the Scenes

Originally UnnValdr was intended to be more limited in his longevity, but as more stories developed and Waylon’s own involvement in the order began spanning generations of members, things changed. It became easier just to give him a long lifespan just to tie everyone’s stories together, however it ended resulting in an OP character, an acceptable one at least.
