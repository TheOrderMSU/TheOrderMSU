## Biography

Isogild was taught the ways of the force as a Jedi youngling. He was given a master at a very early age due to his natural potential in alteration. This unnamed master never truly cared for Isogild, yet the young Arkanian put all of his trust in him. Years later, after Isogild had mastered the basics of lightsaber combat, the two went out to hunt a Sith warrior. The warrior proved to be stronger than expected and critically wounded Isogild before fleeing. Caring more about the escaping Sith than his own apprentice, the unnamed master scolded Isogild for being careless before leaving him for dead. That day, Isogild gave in to the emotions his master always taught him to hold off: fear and hate. However, Isogild's hatred in this moment was enough to manipulate the force into freezing himself within a tomb of ice. During this time, the warrior had been killed by the unnamed master. However, as is commonly known, the Sith was never alone. A Sith Lord also left Isogild wounded and broken, but took off after the Jedi master and murdered him. This was the day before the legendary Order 66 was to have taken place. In that time, Isogild's lightsaber bled from the tremendous hate he felt, but eventually purified in the ice due to the bond it shared with Isogild in his frozen state and the lack of new rage coming through. Several centuries have passed and Isogold was released by a Pengauani named [Shecolag]() and they dueled upon Isogild's awakening. [Shecolag]() defeated Isogild, but spared his life.
