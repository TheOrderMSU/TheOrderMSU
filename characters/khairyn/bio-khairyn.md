## Introduction

Khairyn Arbitrium was a Jedi Knight of the Old Republic before his untimely demise, and a Jedi Master of the New Republic after his revival. He was a member of the secretive Jedi Shadows, alongside other prestigious Jedi Masters such as Sigil and Khairyn's original master, Au'ran. His missions would often take him deep into hostile territory, sometimes weeks, or even months at a time, When he could be found at the Jedi Temple he often took to teaching the younglings what he knew, sometimes regaling them with stories of his journeys throughout the galaxy.


### Leaving the Darkness on Kesh
Born on the primitive planet of Kesh in 1006 BBY, Khairyn was the son of two glassblowers. Early into his childhood, he was found to be special. Objects moving with no explanation. His body seemingly capable of pushing beyond the limits of other boys his age. It worried his parents in a way. They were proud of Khairyn but worried that the Lost Tribe of the Sith, who had been ruling over Kesh for 4000 years prior, would recognize the strange occurrences around Khairyn and take him away.

In 989 BBY, a ship crash landed outside of Khairyn's childhood home. This ship contained a Shistavanen Jedi Master named Au'ran. Khairyn's parents sheltered the Jedi while he repaired his ship. While Au'ran was there, he kept a watch on Khairyn while explaining to the him and his parents about the galaxy at large and about the Jedi Order. Within a week, Au'ran deduced that Khairyn was Force-sensitive, and that that was the explanation for the strange happenings around him.

Au'ran managed to stay hidden from the Lost Tribe of the Sith during his stay at the home, being skilled in hiding himself from their Force enhanced senses. He knew, however, that Khairyn was not. And that eventually the Sith would find him. Au'ran took it upon himself to train the boy to hide himself from the Force-senses of other Force-sensitives. Khairyn took to the training well and within a week, he became skilled enough at it to hide from the average Force user.

Soon, the time came that Au'ran's ship was nearly completely repaired. One night, while Khairyn was sleeping, his parents approached Au'ran with an offer. They wished for Au'ran to take Khairyn away from Kesh and out into the Galaxy at large. Initially, Au'ran was a bit hesitant but then he considered the state of the planet he found himself on. Khairyn would surely be taken by the Sith. In the end, Au'ran agreed to take Khairyn off-world, telling Khairyn's parents that he would take the boy on as his very own personal apprentice; he would become his Jedi Padawan.

They took Khairyn while he was asleep and placed him upon Au'ran's ship. When the Khairyn awoke, the ship was already leaving the planet. Au'ran explained to him that his parents wished for him to leave and that this was the only way out that they could see. Khairyn was understandably upset, immediately breaking into tears. Khairyn wouldn't speak to Au'ran again for the whole trip to Coruscant.

### A Life in the Order

Khairyn took well to his training, mastering his training in both the lightsaber and the Force very quickly. He was among the top duelists of his classes and he quickly picked up on new Force based abilities. There wee many nights however where the boy couldn't sleep. When he did sleep, he had nightmares of his home on Kesh burning, the planet being crushed by people holding crimson lightsaber blades. Eventually a time would come when his time as an Initiate in the Jedi Order would draw to a close. When it came time to be picked as a Master's apprentice Au'ran kept true to his word.

Over the next 8 years, Khairyn would spend a majority of his time out in the field with Au'ran, learning how the Galaxy itself worked. They took to the streets of many city planets such as Coruscant or Nar Shaddaa, but also made themselves at home in the wilds of planets such as Kashyyk, Felucia, or even Tattooine. When they weren't in any of those places, they were seeking out knowledgee in ancient temples around the Galaxy. Khairyn and Au'ran visited places such as Tython, Korriban, Yavin 4, and Dromund Kaas. They always made a point to stay hidden on the more Dark Side oriented planets, not wanting to draw undue attention from ancient Sith spirits, or even worse, actual Sith.

This isn't to say, however, that they always stayed out of trouble. The Master-Apprentice duo always made sure that there was a purpose to the places they were going. Usually that meant breaking up crime syndicates in the seedier parts of the galaxy. Other times it meant destroying pockets  of Dark Side influence, whether they be simple cults or small-scale Sith adherents.
The Trials of Knighthood and the Loss of a Master

Khairyn's time as an Apprentice of the Order could not and did not last. By the time he was 18, Khairyn was fully ready for the trials that would make him into a fully-realized Jedi Knight. When the day came, he passed with flying colors, the Council commending him on his results. Khairyn's methods were unorthodox and perhaps even a bit headstrong, but they exceeded the expectations of those judging him.

At the same time, however, something was wrong. After the completion of his trials, Khairyn felt an emptiness. As if a part of him had left. When he went to retrieve Au'ran for celebrations, he found that something was indeed wrong. Master Au'ran was missing. He had seemingly vanished with no trace. Khairyn was deeply affected by this, becoming solemn for some time before returning to active duty as a Jedi Knight. From then on, he had made his personal mission to find his lost Master, hopefully bringing him back into the Order.

### Run-ins with the Dark Side

While finding Au'ran was an overarching goal Khairyn was still a dedicated Jedi, taking missions from the Order's Masters and sometimes even the Council itself. He would wander through the Galaxy, protecting the unfortunate, and snuffing out the Dark Side wherever he could. Over the next several years, Khairyn personally put down 3 dark side cults, and 6 surviving Sith.

Those that did get away he would keep tabs on. Aspiring Sith such as Draeda or Deus in particular were on his radar. In 985 BBY, he would meet Draeda for the first time. She came to him seeking the Amulet of Phobos, a long dead Dark Lord of the Sith. Due to equal parts cunning, charisma, and Dark Side use, she would convince Khairyn into unveiling the location of the amulet. Afterwards, Khairyn would always make sure to search for signs of Draeda.

In the same year, Khairyn had his first run-in with Sturg'Draco Deus. Khairyn was tracking a crime syndicate that had potentially come in contact with Dark Side artifacts on Nar Shaddaa. At the culmination of this hunt, he had found that the Hutt leading the syndicate was keeping a potentially powerful artifact for himself. As Khairyn came into the Hutt's personal chambers, he was greeted by Deus picking over the corpse of the freshly killed Hutt. The Trandoshan warrior had within his grasp the artifact Khairyn was after.

After a prolonged lightsaber duel, the Hutt's forces intervened. Khairyn was forced to flee out of a window, letting Deus get away with the artifact, just to survive. It was then that Khairyn first tried using the Force to at least levitate. Taking hold of himself with the Force, he guided himself to the nearest landing pad for speeder taxis. Defeated, Khairyn would board his ship and leave the planet.

### Personality and Traits

Khairyn possesses a confident, sarcastic personality. He often finds himself at odds with other Jedi and even the Council itself. There have been many times he has disregarded direct orders from the Council to do what he believed was right. When fighting, he enters an instinct-driven, trance like state. When fighting like this, he draws directly from the Living Force. In the end, however, Khairyn is a Jedi who cares deeply about the Galaxy at large and for the other Jedi, fighting doggedly to protect both. He is a loyal friend, a ferocious warrior, and Master of the Jedi.

### Powers and Abilities

- Khairyn is a superb alterationist. Now that Izen has departed, he is now possibly the most powerful alteration-user in the Jedi Order.

- Khairyn has perfected the use of Force Flight, oftentimes approaching situations from the skies before dropping to the ground to continue his objectives.

- Khairyn has attained mastery of several forms of lightsaber combat to a very high degree. Having mastered Form I: Shii-Cho, Form III: Soresu, and Form IV: Ataru. He has also received training in Form II: Makashi, Jar'Kai, the saberstaff, and has self-taught his proficiency in the Saber Pike.

- Khairyn is skilled in the art of stealth, preferring a silent approach if at all possible. While this may be true, he certainly isn't afraid of prolonged duels if the need arises.
