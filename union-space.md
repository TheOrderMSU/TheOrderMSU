## Q15:

### Algarian

governing bureaucracy. No other information is publicly

credit processing fee to the Algarian Bureau of Planetary
Information and Tourism. Union has added this planet through
several trade deals and assistance after the fallout of the Savage
Massacres.

**Classification:** Fortress World


### Ando
An oceanic planet located in the Ando system of the Mid
Rim. It was also the homeworld of the Aqualish species. Union
gained favor with Ando by uniting the people and helping them
to establish a strong and stable governing body.

**Classification:** Armory World

### Blenjeel
A desert planet between Ando and Kothlis, located far
from the major hyperlanes. It is inhabited by enormous sand
burrowers, which emerged quickly from the ground to devour
unsuspecting prey. The terrain of Blenjeel is comprised mostly
of wide deserts, noted for the unusual consistency of the sand,
which shifted over time. Union has taken ownership of this
planet due to no sentient life on it.

**Classification:** Death World
