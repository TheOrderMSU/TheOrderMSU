## Nobel Beginnings
Draeda was born in 1004BBY on Arkania. She was born of noble heritage and of pure blood. Her father Myani was headmaster at the Academy of Cybernetics and her mother, Vitalani, was a diplomat of high regard. Both took seats on the High Council of Arkania. Draeda lived a comfortable and sheltered life in her early years. In the year 996BBY, Draeda's mother tells her the stories of the legendary Arca Jeth. Vitalani then tells Draeda that she was created using his DNA and that one day she would grow up to do great things.

In 992BBY, Vitalani meets a bitter end when she is murdered by two Arkanian offshoot slaves. The slaves had rebelled against the Academy's experiments and sought revenge by killing the one true love of Headmaster Myani. Since this incident, the experiments and mistreatment of the offshoot slaves only worsened. Myani explains to Draeda, "It is an unfortunate thing that to better ourselves we must first prod at the creatures beneath our feet."

Draeda grew beautiful and well refined. With plans to be like her father, she attended the Academy of Cybernetics in 990BBY. In the middle of her training at the academy Draeda begins to change. The force found Draeda in the form of clairsentience. In her last days at the Academy of Cybernetics, Draeda was forced to suffer with the offshoot slaves. Whatever they felt, so did she. She saw the injustice and grew to understand the importance of reform. She was caught performing several acts of kindess while attending the academy and was punished.

Draeda graduates from the academy in the year 986BBY and immediately begins to push for reform but is ignored time and again. She spent her nights working on methods to keep both Arkanians and offshoots happy but none would hear of it. Before long, Myani grew tired of his daughters ramblings and forbid her to speak of such reformations again saying, "If you continue to fight for those who murdered Vitalani, you are no daughter of mine."

So in the year 985BBY, Draeda leaves Arkania on a cargo ship, trying to escape the pain that the slaves shared with her every day. The ship lands on Soterios where Draeda begins her journey.


### Training and the Path to Phobos
When the ship lands on Soterios, Draeda is unsure what to do but thankfully she meets a fellow Arkanian named Xion. Xion talked to Draeda in secrecy, saying that she had a vision of Draedas’ arrival on Soterios and why she had come to meet her. It was here that Draeda learned that she was strong with the force and Xion offered to train her in the ways of it. Draeda, having no other option and the will to move forward with her new life, agreed to train with Xion on Dathomir.

Draeda trained with Xion for a few short years. She learned to focus her clairsentience and to use her passion to gain power. She planned to use this power to free the slaves of Arkania someday. During this time, Xion had another vision. She saw Draeda more powerful than she ever imagined but something was missing. In this vision Draeda wore an amulet, so strong with dark energy that Draeda became the perfect weapon. The vision also showed Khairyn, the Jedi knight, lighting the way to the amulet that held such great power. Xion told Draeda that her first solo mission was to find this amulet and to control whatever power it held.

Draeda finds Khairyn and, after some persuasion and mind bending, was given the exact location of the amulet. Khairyn did not know exactly what the amulet held or why it was hidden but he told Draeda that it was not an item to be taken lightly. The amulet was with Daelan, who saw Draeda as a misled young lady whos abilities had fallen into the wrong hands. He offered Draeda an apprenticeship with him and asked her to leave the dark side while she still had a chance. Draeda told him that she would take his offer into consideration, if he would hand over the amulet, she would return to him with an answer. Daelan saw many futures and decided that the risk was worth taking. Draeda could make a great Jedi.

> "You can feel the emotions of others. You sense their pain. You want to save them. Xion knows only how to hurt."
>
> — Master Daelan

After leaving, Draeda places the amulet around her neck and discovers that it held the soul of Darth Phobos. She began hearing Phobos inside her head, guiding her actions and pushing her to do what had to be done. Draeda was fearful and made plans to return to Daelan to take his offer but sadly, the Jedi Master was dead. Draeda speaks to his apprentice that was left behind on the battlefield and decides that the Jedi path was not the path she would take. She believes that the only way to win her battles was to use her new companion, Darth Phobos.

### Phobos Takes Control
Draeda continued to train with Xion, who realized immediately that Draeda was beginning to change. Draeda decides that it is time to free the offshoot slaves. Phobos takes over her body and Draeda makes her way to Arkania with Xion and Abyssius (Daelans apprentice) on her tail. Once on the planet, Draeda storms into a meeting of the high council and begins her slaughter. She kills nearly every member of the high council, including her own father, but not in time to stop the call for reinforcements. Draeda is taken captive and Xion and Abyssius make a hasty retreat.

Draeda spends 3 years imprisoned and tortured on her home-planet. She fought the urge to let Phobos take control again. Two offshoot slaves who had heard of Dreads’ intentions came to her rescue. Draeda promises to return and to set them all free. Draeda returns to Dathomir to meet Xion.

> "I will return for you. Please do not loose hope. I will kill anyone who stands in the way of your freedom."
>
> — Draeda to the offshoot slaves.

When Draeda arrives on Dathomir, Xion thinks it best to hide the amulet while Draeda recovered and to focus on teaching Draeda the art of control. Draedas’ training, however, had no chance to begin, for when they returned to Dathomir after hiding the amulet, they were met by Khairyn. Khairyn wanted to fix his mistake of leading Draeda to the amulet in the first place. When Khairyn realizes the amulet is gone, he decides that the next best thing is to kill the only two people who know where it is hidden. After a long and brutal fight, Khairyn retreats, but not before severely injuring Draeda and Xion.
Xion tells Draeda of a mass resurrection in the year 400 ABY and makes the decision to go into a prolonged stasis to heal from their wounds and to hide from the Jedi, if only temporarily. Draeda resurrects in 400 ABY but Xion does not return until 403 ABY. In that time, Draeda goes into hiding and develops her self-control so that she may return for the amulet and finish what she started.

### Draeda The God
Draeda awakens from stasis in the year 405 ABY. Without Phobos to guide her actions, she goes into hiding for 3 years. In this time she works on her control, finds a sense of self and rekindles her own passion.She plans for her second journey to Arkania. When Draeda senses Xion's return she goes to meet her. They spend some time gathering enough forces to aide in the liberation of the Arkanian slaves. Draeda decides that with her newfound control that Phobos would be an asset too valuable to lose. She returns for her and with her new balance of power, is stronger than ever. Phobos and Draeda became 2 sides of the same coin. Draeda was compassionate, strategic, intelligent and could feel the emotions of others. Phobos was strong, fearless, stealthy and could bend the emotions of others. Xion's vision had finally come true. Though Draeda and Phobos would never quite see eye to eye, Draeda was in control.

 This time, with the help of Xion and Shadow, The mission succeeds. To Draeda's surprise she had become a legend. Hundreds of years they had waited for her return and Draeda had become a God. Draeda took them under her wing and transported them to an uninhabited planet on the outer rim. She named the planet Drekonas and made all involved with the settling be sworn to secrecy. New planets are vulnerable and Draeda did not want eyes on her growing civilization. Construction projects took place immediately. The problem at hand was funding her new project.

Draeda takes Charm as her apprentice shortly after. He was chosen for his ability "doppleganger" which replaced real objects with duplicates. She used his new ability to duplicate valuable items. This was effective for not only funding the settlement of her new plantet, but also gaining access to Sith artifacts, holocrons and valuable memorabilia of all varieties. She added these to her personal collections. All the items that were stolen were replaced with Charms "dopplegangers" that would disappear the moment they were touched. Of course, Charm didn't come without some baggage. His "twin" Charisma was a doppleganger gone sentient and often got in the way of Draeda's missions, but was also a grand scapegoat for Charms crimes.

>"Together we show the galaxy how to love and fear at the same time"
>
> — Draeda to her apprentices Zerold and Charm.

### The War of Storms: (see official timeline)

The War of Storms was a tricky time for Draeda who was trying to remain low-profile. She left Charm to the business of her planet and her other apprentice, Zerold, joined her to be by Xion's side until the end. In the end, the planet remained a secret and all parties survived.

### Darth Draeda

After the War of Storms, Draeda goes back to her planet to build an army. She could no longer trust Xion and it became imperative to create a force powerful enough to stand against her when the time came. Using her experience in cybernetics and genetic manipulation, Draeda makes a special forces unit. Each offshoot that was recruited was genetically altered with creature DNA to become more powerful. Some had the ability to breathe underwater and swim at high speeds. Others had armor-like skin and impossible strength. Others were smaller, more stealthy with the ability to blend into surroundings. Of course, her cybernetics did not go unused. Each soldier was given as assortment of alterations that improved their individual functions. They were monsters but they loved Draeda, and Draeda loved them. 

She took 5 of these soldiers back to Arkania for a special mission: acquire the DNA of the Arkanian Dragon. Deep in the mountains, after several days of searching with only the best equipment, Draeda found a perfectly preserved egg in the ice. It was beautiful. She could feel it's power hiding within it's cold shell. She used the DNA from the egg (with a touch of Dathomiri Rock Dragon) and created the first Arkanian Dragon to live for thousands of years. She named the Dragon "Libra" because she "tipped the scales in her favor."

In the following few years Draeda and her planet become recognized by the Senate. Draeda becomes Darth Draeda Drekonas and she becomes the mascot of liberation. Her promises of a better life cause riots on slave-bearing planets and Draeda's army was among the most feared in the wealthiest parts of the galaxy, where Draeda would take what rightfully belonged to her, and her children of freedom. She was a god, a hero, and nothing would stop her. Until the Rise of the Fallen.
