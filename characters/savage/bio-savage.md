> "War is the only thing that shows you what you truly are. You are either hunter or prey, victor or slain. War is what makes the galaxy turn, not the senate, it is the blood shed in the conflict fought throughout the galaxy. And so it is through war the true rulers of the galaxy rise to their true potential. And one unmistakable truth about war is that there can only be one victor. Only one who can be the one to rule the galaxy. And that one victor shall be me."

## The Beginning
Savage was born originally as Rahn Uthsan, He was the first born of twins. On the Mandalorian world of Ku’Thul. The last world of the Taung. His sister Zarha and he where born to the clan chieftain and high priestess of their clan. They were required from the age of 4 to begin both of their own training. Savage was to be the next chieftain, Zarha the next high priestess.  By age 5 they began their combat training, a field they both thrived in. Savage showed that he was the more aggressive of the two siblings. He would train for hours and was the better hand to hand combatant. By the age of 8 they were both in the stage of training reserved for elite of the clans future warriors. They also began their training in the ways of Taung sorcery and alchemy. Both also had a bond that was beyond unbreakable. But by age 12 they both would be separated by the war between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. Both sides had courted the Mandalorians to join there war. Clan Uthsan had declared neutrality and said, “any move to force them to join would be met with force.” This then made both superpowers want to solve what they saw as a threat. Both sent armies to subdue the clan but what followed was a three-way battle.

### The Purging of Ku’thul
Ku’thul which had once been a place of beauty, was now a battleground.The battle was so violent that the rivers near the village where turned to blood within the first hour. The Taung fought with the ferocity and skill they where famous for. By dusk the the Taung where nearly all gone, but the Sith and Jedi dead where unprecedented. Not to metion the amount of dead soldiers for both armies was shocking as well. Savage was with his father in front of the entrance to the path to the Temple of Kalash, the God of War. Savage held off the republic troopers while his father fought the jedi. After killing the troopers near him he looked to see his father fighting the Jedi master leading the attack. His father fought well but was killed by the master. Shock, sadness and anger filled the young warrior, he began marching over to avenge his father when all the sudden darkness.

### The Offer of Vengeance
Rahn then awoke on a ship, none he ever had seen before. Then he saw a tall human across from him. 'A Sith.' Rahn thought. He tried to get up and attack the sith but found himself shackled to the wall of the ship. The Sith then said," I can sense the anger you feel young one. You are the last of your people. The last Taung, the founders of the Mandolorian way of life, what a waste your people where, if only they had joined us then maybe your family would be alive. You have a choice become my apprentice or die like rest of your people. Never able to avenge your family. What will it be boy." Rahn thought for awhile, his hate still as red as the mans eyes. Thinking of every outcome within 2 minutes Rahn made up his mind. He would have vengeance on the Jedi. Rahn the accepted the man offer, to which the man replied," Good. I will take you to Korriban then where I and the other Lords will teach you how to use the force properly unlike your savage people did." Savage, that was what the sith thought of the Taung, Rahn was visibly angered at the remark. Which the Sith smiled at with approval. The Sith then rose and said," What is your name young one. You can keep your given one or chose a new one." After thinking for a bit Savage the decide that he would take the insult from the sith and wear it like armor. "I am Savage and I will have vengeance." To which the Sith then nodded and then said," Good. The next time we meet I will see not a Taung or Mandolorian before me but a Sith." The Sith then exited that area of the ship to what appeared to be the helm.

### The Beginning of Savage's Rise
After 8 years of training in the Sith Temple on Korriban, Savage was made a Warrior of the Sith Order. He had been trained by many of the sith's best and wisest teachers. His master, Lord Duncar Keeper of Secrets for the order, the same man who brought him to Korriban 8 years prior had taught the mandolorian many things. One being how to use his emotions to given him power, but to remain in control of his actions and not get lost in rage unlike the many sith acolytes. Savage had been the most violent of all the acolytes, showing a great deal of promise in saber and hand to hand combat. Using the lessons learned from his father with those of the Sith Blade-master, Savage had been undefeated his entire way through the academy. Now a Warrior, Savage was sent to many planets to fight the Jedi. Using his extreme speed and strength with his talents at combat, the Warrior killed many enemies, and leading Sith forces to victory, earning him glory on the battlefield. It was on one such battlefield Savage would meet the man that made him want vengeance for so long. The Jedi that killed his father and the destroyer of his home. Savage engulfed in rage, but still in control fought the jedi master for what seemed like hours. It only after sustaining massive injuries that Savage struck down the Jedi Master he hated so much. AFter the battle Savage began to see the flaws of the sith. He thought that the sith where fighting eacother more then the Jedi. For the next 4 years Savage fought with the Sith. It was at that point Savage saw that a war was turning against the Sith. With in months Korriban fell and the Sith where all but destroyed. Instead of fleeing with the remnants of the sith into the unknown regions. Savage decided that he would go to Mandolore and be with his people. Once he landed on Mandolore he went to the palace of the Mandolore. It was here he courted the Mandolorian Chieftain Council to reinstate his stats as the Chieftain of Clan Uthsan. After much debate the council decided that Savage would have to pass the rights of passage before he could claim his title of chieftain. Then after completing the rights he then reclaimed the title that was his right from birth. For the next 6 years the mandolorian rebuilt his clan with warriors that proved worthy. He also began his raids on Republic space and the Outer Rim with his growing forces. It was during this time Rahn saw his sister again, who tried to turn him form the dark side. However she failed and he saw her as not only a traitor to their people, but also a traitor to their family.

### The First Death
Two years later over the planet Huthan in the Outer Rim, Savage's forces engaged the majority of the Republic Fleet. The battle was going in his favor until a large force of Jedi arrived to assist the Republic. It was then that a boarding party of elite republic soldiers and Zarha boarded Savage's flagship. The boarding party got to the main lift to Savage's throne room when a company of mandolorians forced Zarha to go alone to face Savage. The battle that would ensue when they reunited for the last time would be a brutal battle. Both where equal in the way of the lightsaber, while Zarha showed she was superior in the ways of the force, and Savage used his superior control and hand to hand skills. The fight would end with Savage being mortally wounded while at the same time he would make a fatal wound upon his sister, this was caused by a stab the went through Zarha's abdomen. It was at this time he felt sad and was sorry for what he had done. But this was quickly snuffed out by the pain he felt from the wound he had received which angered him greatly. Without his guidance and with the Republic's forces now outnumbering them two to one the Mandolorians began to lose ground steadly. Unable to salvage the battle, Savage ordered the detonation of 3 Mass Shadow Generators and had his ship ram and destroy the Republic Fleets flagship. It was this act that would allow the remainder of his forces to escape just moments before the detonation of the three Mass Shadow Generator.

### Return of a Warrior
After more then five thousand years dead, Savage awoke on the surface of the planet Huthan. He found himself confused and in want of answers. This made no sense at all. He found himself still wearing his armor and his lightsaber at his side. The Taung wanted answers and he want them now. He then began the long journey through the dense forests of Huthan. This journey took him an entire month until he found a large town settled in a valley. He entered the town with caution, if he was recognized before he could find out what was going on he could very well be in trouble. As he entered the town most people got out of his way. Many openly saying things like," Why is a mandolorian all the way out here." or," I hope he is just here for a drink. We don't need the trouble mandolorians bring." All of these comments made Savage angry but he knew that they were not important. He then found the local cantina. It was here he decided to get his information. He entered to find bounty hunters, mercenaries, locals, and merchants all chating and  watching the news holorecordings. He sat in the back corner of the cantina and  began to take in all the information. Everything he heard angered him, he had somehow been brought back to life more than five thousand years after his death. His anger became so potent that he could hardly keep from yelling. It was at this moment that a group of local thugs came up to him and started mocking him. " Your a long way from home mandolarian. We don't like your kind around here. All you murders ever do is bring pain to our people. But we don't fear you. Not since the defeat of Rahn the Ignorant. Now how about you..." that was it. He began to choke the leader with the force. The others shocked and confused drew their blasters, only to find that he had a lightsaber. His anger was as visible as day, he would make them all pay. He killed every single person in that cantina. He left no witnesses. He would not be mocked by anyone ever again. After his killing spree he took a large amount of credits from some of the dead and made his way to the spaceport. Where he bought a ticket to Mandolore.

### Reclaiming His Birthright
It was once at Mandolore that Savage then made his way to the tombs of the now fallen Clan Usthaun. It was on his way there that he found out that the current mandolore had died of old age, and that a new mandolore was to be chosen from any who wish to take the title. It was then that Savage decided that he would enter the contest. First he would need to prove that he was a mandolorian. To do this he entered the tomb of Clan Usthaun which can only be opened by a member a the clan since only they would know the code to enter. He then gathered artifacts to prove his identity. The next day he went to the temple of Karthus God of Destiny and gave the artifacts to the head priest. Who at first was shocked, he almost fainted at the sight of the Taung. But after much study of the artifact as well as the bloodline ritual the head priest gave the Taung the blessing of Karthus and welcomed him back to his people and restored his title and birthright as head of his clan. But Savage had bigger plans he wanted not only to restore his clan. He wanted to restore his people back to their former glory. It was at this point that he entered the contest for Mandolore. He fought the four other claimants in a duel to the death. After a long and bloody duel Savage was the last man standing. He then took the title of Mandolore the Chosen.

### Approached By A God
After his rise to the title of Mandolore, the Dark Lord of the Sith Deus approached Savage with an offer. Savage could become his apprentice and a vassal of his Star Kingdoms, or Savage could die by the hands of the Sith'ari. Savage chose to bend the kneel, however, he would never forgive his new master and would have vengeance for this slight on his honor. Savage began to learn under the Sith'ari while keeping control over all Mandolorian territory. It was several years later that the War of Storms began.

### War of Storms
Savage was largely inactive during the War of Storms since he was organizing his forces and guarding Deus's flank from the Republic. He did however assist Deus in several offensive attacks near the end of the war. It was thanks to these offensives that Savage became a respected and well-known tactician and strategist. After these offensives a cease-fire was called and Savage began to notice movement on his borders with the unknown regions. Savage analyzing the situation moved his forces to guard his flank.

### The Fallen
The Fallen first attacked the Mandolorians and Chiss. Savage saw that his forces where unable to hold the fallen of at once so he began to fall back gradually. Deus rewarding him for his leadership and tactical ability granted him the rank of warrior. Savage went with the sith to hold off the sister while the brother fought the jedi. Savage was one of the sith that killed the sister but was almost overcome by his rage. Then after Xion's escape form death and Dosh Savage accompanied Deus in his hunt for Xion. The two of them confronted the witch and after killing her followers and her force powers not working she fled, Deus knowing that Savage wish to kill her sent him after the witch. Savage fought his way through dozens of fanatic followers, only to narrowly miss the witch who escaped from his grasp. For the next two years Savage continued to build up his power base and empire. As well as learning and studying mass amounts of ancient sith knowledge particularly sith sorcery and alchemy. Deus also gave Savage the responsibility of governing Dathomir.

### The Evil From Within

With visitors from another universe taking the attention of the majority of the universe especially Deus, Savage used this distraction to build up his power and began to experiment on the consuming of dark side energy form the witches of Dathomir. With him doing this he also learned to use the power known as mind shard which he used to extract information from the jedi knight Aethrous as well as cripple the young knights memories and mind. Later Savage was visited by the AU sith Ho-No who assisted him in his torture of Aethrous. Sometime later Savage was confronted by the redeemed Alluria and Mairthu on Dathomir. Thanks to his consuming of dark side power Savage was more powerful then ever before and easily defeated Alluria in a contest of Terra Kasi. He then later tortured and drained most of her remaining dark side power, before she was rescued by the Grandmaster of the Jedi and Sigel. Savage would hold off the two master and would force Sigel to flee. But was wounded by the Yathel but spared by the Grandmaster. Angered by this Savage vowed vengeance on the Grandmaster. Sometime later Savage led the ground forces against the AU Sith. Savage ended up killing and draining Terial of his force power and at the same time breaking the spell that force him to stay obedient to Deus. Then later on he faced Casphics and wounded the dark lord before his death and began to prepare for the next conflict.
