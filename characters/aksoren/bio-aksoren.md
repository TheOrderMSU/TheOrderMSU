### Early Life

Aksoren Ral, a Verpine, was born on the Roche Asteroid Field in 405 ABY.

In 411 ABY, Aksoren volunteered for a small team excavation of a nearby asteroid for minerals. The trip became catastrophic when the cave system collapsed unexpectedly. Aksoren was the only survivor thanks to his unknown connection to the Force, which allowed him to push rocks out of the way from crushing him. After many days, he was finally able to dig his way out and to the surface of the asteroid, though not without both antennae suffering damage (which is significant because Verpine use their antennae to communicate). Since most Verpine with broken antennae were criminals and there really wasn’t any place for a Verpine with broken antennae, Aksoren left on the next merchant ship he could find.


### Transition Years

For the next five years, Aksoren roamed the galaxy from place to place, taking odd jobs on freighters as an engineer or mechanic. On one such job, he met a female Halim/Kaladi hybrid named Malakardi, and the two quickly became best friends.

Like Aksoren, Malakardi came from a tight-knit community, in her case a clan instead of a hive. And Malakardi too shared with Aksoren a sense of isolation from her home. But unlike Aksoren, Malakardi had never fit in among her people because of her unusual appearance. In fact, most people mistook her for a Gungan, which didn't bother her because it was easier to explain.

Malakardi taught Aksoren many things. She showed him how to swim, which he had never done before and became very good at. She also explained about her name. Among Kaladi, her mother's people and the ones who raised her, each name a child is given has significance. The first name, the Parent Name, is the one you are known by to strangers. The middle name, the Clan Name, is what the clan calls you by, and no one else is supposed to hear it. The last name, the Personal Name, is chosen by each individual, and only spoken once in their lifetime.

Malakardi's full name is a reflection of this, and the subtle meanings of Kaladi words. Her full name is Malakardi Meliru Kendirratan. "Malakardi", her Parent Name, means "strange, special one". "Meliru", her Clan Name, literally translates to "salt-bark tree growing by itself in the middle of the ocean". But in context it means, "one who stubbornly goes her own way". This is actually a tie-back to Malakardi's mother, who chose this name for herself.  Finally, "Kendirratan" means "one who was thought to be dead, and is much loved". Malakardi chose this name herself. While it is partly in honor of a famous Kaladi named Kendara, it also betrays the constant isolation that Malakardi feels, both from her family and from the world. She has said as much on many occasions, saying that she doesn't belong anywhere.

Aksoren was inspired by Malakardi's story to choose his own last name, Melir'suin. A variant of Meliru, it means, "saltbark tree in the middle of the ocean building an island", or "one who builds a foundation". Malakardi later gave Aksoren a shell necklace to wear, and told him she would always be able to find him if he ever got into trouble. She meant it, too. While she was not Force-sensitive, Malakardi possessed an uncanny ability to locate anything or anyone she wished to find. This earned her plenty of jobs as a private investigator, among other things.

### Becoming a Jedi

Aksoren and Malakardi moved from job to job for a few years until Jedi Master Luxilis Kannur (Nautolan) finds them in 416 ABY. The two friends were inside a cantina were they were threatened by a thug. Aksoren instinctively reacted by Force Pushing the thug across the cantina. Master Kannur happened to be in the cantina and helped the two escape the scene before too much fuss came about. He offered to train Aksoren in the ways of the Force, explaining what it meant for him to have such powers. Aksoren accepted on the condition that Malakardi would be allowed to come along as well, to which the Nautolan hesitantly agreed.Aksoren trains with Master Kannur for the next 10 years. Malakardi stayed nearby, and often accompanied them on missions.

### War of the Storms

When The War of the Storms began in 427 ABY, the duo was sent to Sankor to investigate reports on the Sith. Malakardi was supposed to accompany them, but at the last minute, she was called upon to find an official's missing child. Upon arriving, Master Kannur and Aksoren were ambushed by a group of Sith led by Darth Vytrius. They were transported to a space station and held in captivity.

After a couple months, Malakardi was able to find them by using her special ability to track down whatever she wants to find. Sneaking into the compound, she retrieves both lightsabers and the keys to both Jedi’s cells. She frees the weak Aksoren and says that they should leave immediately. However, Aksoren demands to go back and free his master. Malakardi reluctantly goes with him to free Kannur, but they find the Jedi Master has been removed from his cell and taken to the center of the station. There, he is executed by Darth Vytrius with roaring applause.

Upon seeing this, Aksoren and Malakardi flee for the nearest ship they can find, though not before an alarm sounds for Aksoren’s escape. They barely make their way to a ship evading guards and Sith in the hallways when a large group of them turn a corner. Malakardi reaches into her bag and pulls out Kannur’s lightsaber, insisting Aksoren leave with the rest of her possessions in her bag. Malakardi shoves the defiant Verpine into the ship before igniting the saber and fighting off the oncoming Sith. Aksoren readies the ship, but Malakardi closes the air lock before boarding. He watches as just before the ship leaves the station, Malakardi turns to look at him and slices her own throat with the lightsaber, ensuring he won’t return to save her and risk his own life.

Finally returning a few weeks later to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Aksoren relayed the information and dreadful news to the Council. He was reassigned to Master Rhyme, a Rodian, to complete his training.
