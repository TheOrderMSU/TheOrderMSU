## Introduction

Yathel'con te D'mori, or simply Yathel, is a Hysalrian Jedi Master hailing from the Pre-Clone Wars and Clone Wars era of the Jedi Order, currently the Grandmaster of the Order during the New Republic.

A mentor to younglings at the Temple and a lover of adventuring across the galaxy, Yathel is a well rounded Jedi who has lived a long life of over 600 years with many still ahead of him. A practitioner of Teras Kasi, a hand-to-hand style of using the Force, and skilled in multiple forms of Lightsaber combat, he is a force to be reckoned with. However, he prefers peaceful resolution and views death as the absolute last option to take. Yathel may come across as very reserved and quiet, but his care for all forms of life and the wisdom of his advice make him a great ally and friend.

### Early Years

Yathel was born on Hysalria in 257 BBY, then taken to the Jedi Temple of Coruscant at the age of three. Over his years as a youngling he spent most of his spare time reading in the library, roaming the gardens, or meditating in the Room of a Thousand Fountains. He did his best in his studies and gave it his all in training, but he still fell behind in his class. As an uncommon serpentine species, many of the other younglings thought he was very odd and kept their distance, talking about him behind his back. Yathel eventually did speak with Master Yoda about the issue and eventually learned to accept that "it matters not what others think of you, if your heart they have not seen."

When the time came for his Initiate Trials, he had improved. Sadly, it wasn't enough. He tried again many times, but couldn't seem to succeed. Finally, after two years of rigorous training and late nights studying, he passed his trials. However, this was not the end of his struggle. Even after demonstrating his skills before the Masters and Knights at the Temple, none decided to choose him as their padawan learner. Yathel was broken and downcast, but he quickly picked himself back up and continued to learn all he could while he still remained at the Temple, hopeful that he would be picked soon.

After about a year Yathel was visited by a Jedi Master in his room who informed him of his summons. His eyes were alight, but the sparkle faded when he was told he still had not been chosen. He feared he would be asked to leave the Order, but a smile came back to his face when he was told the Force had guided the Council of Reassignment to place him in the Exploration Corps. They weren't mentioned much in the Temple, but Yathel had read about the ExplorCorps. He was excited to join adventurers amidst the stars and prepared for departure with a shuttle of supplies to a praxeum ship the next week.

### The ExplorCorps

Yathel spent many years aboard the Luminosity praxeum ship after his arrival in 242 BBY in many different stations. He helped the archaealogists with digging, aided the researchers with the findings, and even did programming for mapping software. But his favorite part of the ExplorCorps was by far the exploration. He was always ready to go when asked to accompany a group of scouts onto unknown planets. It was fascinating to see all the new life that hadn't been seen before. He had a knack for connecting with the flora and fauna of the planets they visited, but there were times when it wasn't so friendly in return. His saber skills and discovery of hand-to-hand Force fighting was sharpened on such missions. He grew close to a few of the other members of the ExplorCorps over such missions and by simply spending so much time with them.

Ten years later, Yathel was nearly an expert on how the Luminosity functioned both as a ship and as a crew. He headed many missions, some successful and others not quite. He was highly respected among his peers and had even become a decent pilot, though he hated flying, preferring to be on the ground connected to nature. He and two of his friends received a particular mission to transport new found creatures to Mycroft, the base of the Intergalactic Zoological Society. The journey was smooth sailing until the raucous animals were loose in the transport ship. Yathel and his companions had trouble corralling them, but Yathel somehow calmed them through the Force and gently urged them back into their containers. The two other Jedi were awed by the act, but Yathel simply shrugged it off, saying he had no idea how he was able to do it anyway.

Upon arrival into the Mycroft system, Yathel felt something unique. He hadn't ever felt it before, but he knew it was important. His colleagues didn't feel anything, though, so he dismissed the sensation. During the transfer of the creatures one of them walked to the edge of its container and reached for Yathel, who reached out one of his four hands to stroke its fur gently. Moments afterwards a Bothan walked up and praised Yathel for his connectivity with the animals. The Bothan introduced himself as Jedi Knight Candem Dominia, and offered to train Yathel as his padawan. After recovering from the shock of such an offer he accepting, much to his friends' excitement. The four departed for the Luminosity to inform the head of the crew about Yathel's departure. He made his goodbyes and packed up what little he had to begin his padawan training. Finally.

### Chosen At Last

Master Dominia and Yathel made a great team from the start. Dominia has a lover of adventure, just like Yathel, so the two had many exciting trips across the galaxy. Still yet, though, many missions went a bit sour due to the suspicious looks the duo received. A Hysalrian was easily spotted in even a thick crowd. So, Dominia began teaching Yathel how to use a Force cloaking technique and put him through practicing it in the field by almost always taking public transportation. Over the years, Yathel mastered the ability and the two were able to complete their missions far easier.

During this time, Dominia decided that Yathel should be given true hand-to-hand training. He sent his padawan to Karvoss II to learn with the Matukai, and the people accepted him into their teachings. He remained on the planet for two years and learned as much as he could, mastering hand-to-hand and even learning their wan-shen weapon style. When Master Dominia came back to retrieve his student he was impressed, promising Yathel that he would guide him to his next step toward knighthood: Illum.

Yathel didn't particularly like the freezing planet at first, and his master put that to use for training. Rather than landing near the caves' entrance, Dominia touched down miles away and forced the bare skinned serpent to slither through the snow and ice. To his surprise, after a short while, Yathel was able to withstand the cold to the point he didn't really notice it at all, thanks being to the Matukai's training. Once they reached the caves, Dominia sent his padawan inside while he waited at the entrance. Yathel searched and searched for what felt like hours, following the call he felt as best he could. Eventually he came to a chamber where he could see his crystal across a chasm that was too wide for him to reach across. Trusting the Force in its urging to cross anyway, he found that the floor was simply transparent. That, or the Force created one for him. Either way, he paid no mind after retrieving his lightsaber crystal.

Once master and apprentice were reunited they returned to the ship where Yathel took his lightsaber that was given to him as a padawan and began to exchange the crystals. Dominia stopped him, explaining that he was to construct a new saber, but could still keep his old one until then. So, the duo set across the galaxy after Yathel made a blueprint for a lightsaber pike based on the design of Senya Tirall of the Knights of Zakuul. Traveling from planet to planet, bonding with one another and helping those in need along the way, they eventually amassed all the parts they needed. Then they returned to Coruscant where Yathel holed himself away in a meditation chamber for three days putting his saber together properly. When he emerged, he demonstrated his new lightsaber against other padawans and even a couple Masters in the training halls. Training in wan-shen truly paid off in this new style.

### Knighthood

After a another nine to ten years of learning under Master Dominia, it was time to face the Trials. Yathel, though nervous, was confident that he had been prepared for them by his many endevours and missions. His Trial of Skill was passed by his ability to effectively use his lightsaber, one of unique design that most thought was impractical. His Trial of Courage was passed from many showings of heroics on the battlefield through the ExplorCorps. He also passed the Trial of the Flesh by going through the grueling training on Karvoss II with the Matukai. However, to pass the other trials would not be any easier. He was led to a small meditation chamber and instructed sit within and meditate. He allowed the Force to flow through him and was met by a vision of one of his dearest friends from his days in the ExplorCorps tortured to the point of death, forced to face the fact that she was gone. For his Trial of Insight, he was led to the Temple gardens. They had changed and grown to be different than what he first remembered, and he was instructed to find a particular insect and return it to the Council. After completing the task many imposter bugs later, he was then sent back to the gardens to await summons. His master came to him a little while after and guided him to a room that was pitch black. There, all at once, every member of the Jedi High Council activated their lightsabers along with Dominia. So in 218 BBY, Yathel was Knighted by his master to begin his own journey through the galaxy with the Force as his guide.

Seeking more knowledge that was not accessible to him as a padawan learner, Yathel set to traveling the galaxy on his own. Many of his escapades found him in exotic situations. One such instance was on Tatooine in a local bar in which he heard a band playing. He enjoyed the music, never quite sitting down and truly relaxing and listening. This sent him in search of an instrument for himself and came across a bowed string instrument which he spent the remainder of his years learning. He also revisited the ExplorCorps on many occassions as well, meeting old friends and joining them on missions. Every now and again he would return to the Temple on Coruscant and took up a few padawans of his own from time to time. All was well and he met with his master from time to time to missions and just to chat, but the fateful day they both knew would come arrived. Yathel cremated the body of Candem Dominia in 157 BBY.

### Settling Down

Many years later, he completed one of his padawans' training and supervised her Jedi Trials at the Temple (98 BBY). Afterwards he decided that he done enough venturing through the galaxy and chose to stay at the temple. There he began teaching younglings about the Force and training a few himself in private lessons. He did this for some time, and when Jocasta Nu stepped down from the High Council he was offered her seat. He politely declined, stating he simply wasn't interested in the position. He trained many Jedi from the rank of youngling up through Knight up until he found a special padawan he connected with.

### A Fateful Apprentice

Natsirt Din was a young human who Yathel trained in the Temple. The two created a special bond and Yathel requested to the council that he take on the boy as his apprentice. After they accepted, the young boy was excited to begin learning. The two traveled the galaxy, just as Master Dominia had done with him. When the Clone Wars started, the two managed to stay out of the conflict until the ending months. The two were sent with a Jedi Master a battalion of clones to the supposed secret base of the Confederacy. Upon arrival, their communications were jammed and a huge ambush ensued. They were outnumbered and the Master fell to a devastating arial strike. Natsirt was hit and fell motionless to the ground, but Yathel was too far away to sense his life force. He started rushing toward his fallen padawan but suddenly all when black.

Yathel returned from the battle broken and tired, carrying the broken corpse of his apprentice into the temple without a word. He cremated the body and requested to take a leave. The Council attempted to inquire, but he simply stated he had to go deal with the loss on his own. With their permission, Yathel took his personal fighter and flew toward the edge of Unknown Space. He forged into Hyperspace, but not long after he felt an unbearable pain within him. Unbeknown to him, Order 66 was issued and his entire life as he knew it was destroyed. He made sure to pull out of Hyperspace, though it was rough, and then he blacked out again, falling through the vast emptiness of space.

### Exile

When Yathel finally came to, he found himself thrown from the wreckage that was his ship. He didn't recognize the planet, so he knew he was lost to the Republic. He searched the crash for what belongings had survived, but he found none. Even his lightsaber was completely shattered. He went to find a secluded place and meditated. He struggled to percieve anything for a while, then suddenly the entire event that transpired with Order 66 flashed before him. He snapped back to reality and fell limp to the ground, the pain returning to his chest. He finally gathered himself and went back to meditating, asking the Force to show him the history of the planet. When he was given no response, Yathel went to exploring his new home.

The planet was covered in forests, swamps, mountains, wide grassy plains, and vast oceans. Yathel spent years traveling, searching for anything he could. After about one hundred years he finally came across a small village that had obviously been abandoned for millenia. He found very little, but there was a map that showed other villages and a tall mountain covered in clouds far to the north. He took it and made it his objective to visit each village, temple, and eventually the mountain.

In his exploration he came across many artifacts and ancient knowledge. He found a wooden quarterstaff that somehow miraculously survived in prime condition. He took it as his own, along with some scrolls so he could study on his travels. After years more of searching and studying he found more and more about the mountain and the supposed temple past the covering of clouds: the Crystalline Peak. He also found an ancient code that he later learned to be the Je'daii code:


_There is no ignorance, there is knowledge._

_There is no fear, there is power._

_I am the heart of the Force._

_I am the revealing fire of light._

_I am the mystery of darkness._

_In balance with chaos and harmony,_

_Immortal in the Force._

This code gave Yathel peace of mind and a way to view his predicament in a positive light. Around two hundred years after his crash on the planet he finally made it to the base of the snow capped mountain in the far north. He scaled it for what felt like weeks, pushing through blizzards and hail storms. Just when he was about to give up, his persistence prevailed and the clouds broke away to reveal a bright blue sky as the background for a gorgeous temple etched from the mountain top. Ornate and very well preserved from being protected by the weather by the Force, it gave a perfect view of the surrounding land for kilometers around. The clouds were no longer there, simply a Force illusion to help preserve the secrecy of the temple from those unworthy of reaching it. It had apparently been there before the Je'daii refugees had arrived and even among their culture the temple's existence was debated.

He took up to living in the Crystalline Peak, always coming back to it after venturing for a month or so around the base of the mountain again. No longer did he fight the storm to return, since it wasn't there for him anymore. He connected with the local wildlife and learned many new abilities, specifically being taught how to heal organic material down to the level of cells. He didn't excel in healing animals or his own body, but his skill healing and manipulating plants shined.

Yathel came across a library within the temple and spent days going through the scrolls, tomes, and what few holocrons were left over from the Je'daii occupation. There were stories of a hidden crystal chamber within the temple. He searched for years to no avail, but then one day he simply strolled about the temple and felt a slight twinge as he passed through a corridor. He found a secret passage that led deep into the mountain and followed it deep into the darkness, relying on only his hearing, touch, and the Force to guide him. Minutes piled up and eventually Yathel had no idea how long he had been slithering down the corridor. Then, out of nowhere, light flooded his vision and he found himself in a cavern adorned with luminous crystals. In the center was a pedestal above which floated a shining crystal unlike the others. Yathel walked up and examined it before slowly grabbing it. Everything went dark and the floor felt as though it gave way from beneath him, then he opened his eyes to find himself within the central hall of the temple grasping the lightsaber crystal within his hand.

### Return

In 312 ABY a ship soared through the planet's atmosphere and landed in a nearby village. Yathel saw it from Crystalline Peak and began to make his trek down the mountain. He met them and learned they were sent by the Jedi Order. Yathel thought he was having hallucinations until they showed him their lightsabers. He was taken aback, unbelieving of what was going on. They explained what had gone on and he slowly began to understand. Yathel offered for them to stay in the village for a few days to rest since they had been scouting for some time and went back to the temple. There he meditated on what to do about the encounter, coming to the conclusion that it was time to return to the Order. The next morning he met them and told them he would join them in returning to the Order. He packed his things and they left the next day, returning to Coruscant.

Things had changed so much he barely recognized the inside of the temple. It took him a while of roaming amidst the halls and gardens to finally take everything in. He again found himself alone, not knowing anyone. He saw the younglings he trained, his friends meandering through the halls, the old Masters debating on important matters. Slowly things began to settle down and he moved into the new flow of the Temple. Yathel returned to teaching the younglings and even going on recruiting missions every so often. The order wasn't quite the size anymore than it was by the time of the Clone Wars, so he had to fill in for different jobs and tasks.

After Uun' Vuldar began bringing back beings from the past in 400 ABY, Yathel had many run ins with Sith that were now spread across the galaxy. One such Sith was Darth Draeda, apprentice to the Force Witch Xion. The two encountered one another many times but they all ended as incomplete duels and fights, leading the two to form a competition of sorts. But what little peace was still preserved eventually shattered, much to Yathel's dismay.

### The War of Storms

In 427 ABY, the War of Storms took off. A familiar of war, the Order asked him to participate in many planning sessions, though he didn't enjoy any part of it. However, he did do his part and what was necessary. Early on in the war, Yathel aided in guarding Xion when she was captured by the Jedi and held in the Temple, but her escape led to another encounter and draw with Draeda. He was injured and forced to remain in the Temple healing chambers until recovered. Once healed, he was sent to continue aiding in the war.

Shadow attacked one of the Republic flagships Yathel was stationed on, leading Xion's forces of Sith underlings and abominations. The Jedi were victorious, capturing all the Sith, including Shadow and a Cathar/Diathim hybrid who called herself Risa. Yathel sensed there was something very different about her compared to the rest. It was found that she had had light side energy within her. Yathel took her to the Jedi Temple to begin cleansing the corruption of Sith Alchemy from her body and proceeded to teach her as his apprentice after she recovered.

### The Fallen

Eventually the War of Storms drew to an end in 428 ABY, but only due to a greater threat against the galaxy. Yathel had just become a Jedi Master before he was asked to accompany Izen, Khairyn, and Sigil to escort Kreed to Mortis for his final trial for turning against the Republic to join Deus. There he showed faith in his old companion, but the trial came for all of them when the Brother of the Fallen appeared and almost killed them all before they narrowly escaped.

The war against the Fallen continued for some time, and about the time that the armies of both Jedi and Sith amounted to face the Brother, Yathel received a message from an old student he knew to have been dead: Zerold. The two met up and the young Miralukan confessed to realizing the Dark Side was wrong, but Yathel suspected a trap from Draeda. He forced Zerold to duel him to prove he was true in his denouncing the darkness. Afterwards he took his new apprentice with him to meet the armies in their attack against the Brother.

### Grandmaster Yathel

> Yathel to Daelan, discussing being chosen as Grandmaster

Finally the Sister of the Fallen was defeated and the galaxy began to settle down as whole. But unknown to Yathel, it was just beginning for him. He was called to the Council Chambers by Izen, where he met with the Jedi Grandmaster alongside the Miralukan Master Kreed and Rodian Master Rhyme. Yathel did not understand why he had been called until Izen began speaking of choosing the next grandmaster of the Jedi Order. The Hysalrian grew tense, unsure of what even the immediate future held. Then it struck him: Izen had chosen him to be his successor.

Congratulations went around amidst the small group before each left, leaving the new grandmaster alone in the quiet room with the sun's setting glow lighting the room. He spent a long time lost in thought, contemplating how much this would truly change his life. Daelan entered and spoke with him, pledging his blade to the new head of the Order just as he had done with the previous. Yathel bid him his best wishes as he left for Dosha to the blood battle that was to take place between the Battlemaster and the Force Witch Xion. Afterwards he began moving what few things he had into the grandmaster's chambers where Izen met him for a private chat. After the Kel Dor took his leave, Yathel hurried to make it to Dosha. He'd warned the Jedi Order that the duel would not be one for the eyes of the faint-hearted, but with his lack of extreme Sense capabilities he felt the need to go and watch for himself, using Force Cloaked to prevent himself from being noticed. After the duel and the presumed death of Xion, he immediately left and went back to the Temple. He still had much to do.

Following the incidents regarding the Fallen and the vendetta between Daelan and Xion, Yathel was called for an audience with Chancellor Kaina. Yathel had no idea what it was for, but he had an uneasy feeling about the meeting, more so than usual when it came to politics. Kaina informed the new Jedi Grandmaster of the Senate's decision to remove the Order's service from the Republic. Yathel could barely believe what he heard, but he calmly thanked the Chancellor for telling him and for her politeness and best wishes for the Jedi. Once he relayed the information to the Order, he expressed his wish to leave the Temple on Coruscant. He felt that remaining in the heart of the Republic as their primary base would only add to the friction that already existed. After long deliberation with the Jedi Council, it was decided that the Order would disperse throughout the galaxy and still aid assistance to those in need of it. The location for a new Jedi Temple was decided to be on the planet of Volik in what was formerly known as Unknown Space. It wasn't far from Ilum, a sacred world to the Jedi, and the planet was uninhabited at the time. It was also once the home to a Jedi Master named Dorin Se'ol, and Mount Verona was strong in the Force. After two years, a sufficient Temple had been constructed near the mountain atop a plateau surrounded by canyons and beautiful waterfalls. Here Yathel hoped to offer a place for the Jedi to remove themselves from the pressure of the the chaotic galaxy and recenter themselves to their core beliefs, to regain focus of what being a Jedi was truly about before times of war.

After a while of overseeing the new temple's construction, Yathel couldn't find his students. After some interrogation amid informants going to and from the temple he learned that his two padawans had sneaked away behind his back to join Master Rhyme on Operation Midsummer. So Yathel spent his time helping others about the temple, awaiting the praxeum ships' return. During this time he gave personal lessons to those who wanted them, including teaching Solaire how to effectively use the Force Cloaking technique.

### Personality and Traits

Very quiet and collected in personality, Yathel often times remains unnoticed unless he announces his presence. He almost always keeps a nearly flat expression adorned on his face, though his features prevent much expression from showing at all. He prefers to stay to himself to either read or meditate among the gardens of the Temple. He stays cool almost all of the time, but he can still be fearsome. For many years he has trained exceptional younglings at the Temple on Coruscant, some of which were cocky in their abilities. While training, his serene aura becomes stone hard. He is known as one of the most grueling and intense trainers in the Order, both before the Clone Wars and in the New Republic. He is often criticized for being too harsh on his students, but each become splendid Jedi in their own right.

Despite his rough and cold front, Yathel is very kind at heart. He loves all forms of life, flora and fauna, simple and sapient. He doesn't like to let it show, but he cares for all his comrades and peers with fierce compassion. Yathel will always attempt negotiation before aggression, and even then his primary weapon is his quarter staff. But the moment he draws his blade, foes be warned: he will fight to his last breath to defend what he believes in.

### Behind the Scenes

Yathel's string instrument is based off the designs and sounds of the Chinese Ehru and Mongolian Igil, but can also be plucked to sound similar to a Sitar or Koto.

Yathel is played by MSU Order member Tristan Hinkle.
