## Introduction

Branyx Nopur (Kreed) is a Jedi saved from his upbringing with the dark side through his father. Branyx was raised through Krieg, a strong member of the Sith and a wanted Miraluka, leading his son on an almost constant move, never having time to question or second-guess. After much hardship and a stroke of what some what could be called fate, Branyx found a way out of this life and into the Jedi Order after finding his first Master, Vaan. At the temple in Coruscant, Branyx would take the name Kreed in order to remind himself to strive to be a better man than his father. He trained and took up many responsibilities, including but not limited to, tending to the library, teaching younglings, and even representing the Jedi on occasion in the Galactic Senate.  Kreed met his demise in the Battle of Coruscant at the hands of Anakin Skywalker.

### Powers and Abilities

Kreed, being a Miraluka, is a master of Force Sight, using his attunement with the Force in order to discern his surroundings and react accordingly to oncoming threats with a heightened awareness. Further experimentation with his Sense powers has let Kreed access a variety of powers, such as disabling connections to the force and many mental-based powers of suggestion.

Kreed [was] also the Primary Elder of Soresu, suiting his extremely defensive nature in most single opponent combats.  Through mastery of this form and others, he continues to find new ways to blend styles in order to put an end to a conflict as quick as possible.

Given his defensive demeanor, Kreed is also not a fast-paced duelist.  He is often referred to as the Master Turtle, due to his tendency to defend for long periods of time and striking when the enemy lets their guard down.
