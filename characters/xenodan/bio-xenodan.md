### 25,783 BBY

As one of the Je'daii who sued for peace between what would become the modern Jedi and Sith orders Xenodan has always been caught between the two as he originally hails from a time when they were one and the same. Shortly thereafter Xenodan enlisted the help of the Masters at the time to place him in a form of suspended animation using the Force and a Kyber crystal chamber. He asked to be brought back whenever the Sith made a return to the galaxy so that he could negotiate or deal with them himself - "No man should have to cut down their brothers."

### 32 BBY

With more than 150 years of relative inactivity but the Jedi Council still sensing the ever present and foreboding growing presence of the dark side they awaken Xenodan and both inform him of the Rule of Two and send him to the Outer Rim to begin searching for these hidden Sith and to work his way inward.

Shortly after his search begins Xenodan is caught in a spatial flux between a Magnetar and a Black Hole, this causes his ship to be thrown through a worm hole when he activates the hyperdrive to try and
escape.

### XXX ABY
> Author's note: Basically whenever the ass end of Season 3 would have been happening in Order RP.

Xenodan emerges from the worm hole and after landing on an outer rim world for repairs a brief look at the holo net and some other sources tells him that things have gone a little bit off the rails,
planning wise. Realizing that he doesn't even know what he does not even know he decides to make himself useful to the galaxy at large by staying in the Outer Rim for a while, dismantling crime rings,
slavers, dark side cults and the like while flying under the radar.

After emerging on the galactic scene he found he had several problems with how everything was being run.

The Jedi were so hog tied with being Lawful that they allowed evil to flourish so really they were more obedient and obedience is a vast difference from good.

The Senate was full of greedy, squabbling delegates who wanted more political power and wealth for themselves rather than the good of their peoples.

The Sith were self serving megolomaniacs that tended to burn out and take up too whole sectors with them at a time.

The Republic was fine with exploiting the Mid and Outer Rim worlds through wars, famine and cross world epedimics but Force forbid they be allowed to have the same rights or protections as everyone else
once the crisis had abated.

And The Hutts well they were perfectly fine to play every one of these parties against each other and sit pretty atop their throne of blood money and bodies.

This was not what his brothers envisioned.

This was not right.

So he took matters into his own hands first by trying things the Jedi way. This ended with the galaxy in flames, Coruscant eaten and the perpetrator being allowed to live. Then he tried negotiating with the Sith and only found a single sane one among them, a Lord Stryder. So finally he settled for a mix of the two...as it always should have been. With Stryder standing with him they eradicated almost all of the Hutts and the Hutt Empire and reforged its ill gotten gains into a safe and secure society for all. Union Space.

### Personality and Traits

> "The 'good guys' seem to think they're better than the people they save now, but here they stand good men doing nothing and while evil triumphs and their rigid pacifism crumbles into blood stained dust the only victory afforded to them is that they stuck true to their 'beliefs'. They are cowards. Evil is evil. Lesser, greater, middling... makes no difference. ... If I'm to choose between one evil and  another, I'd rather not choose at all."

Xenodan believes entirely in doing the right thing even if that winds up damning his own soul to get it done. Torture a mad bomber to reveal the location of a bomb in a city, done. Force choke or Force  lightning a person holding a blaster to a hostages head to save the hostage, done. Blow up a deserted planet with him on it to stop a dark side spirit vampire who eats worlds from eating even a single citizen of Union Space, done. If the net total is a greater good he's willing to sacrifice whatever necessary to see it come to fruition up to and including his own body, soul or mind.
