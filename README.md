Welcome to the GitHub repository for the MSU Order. Here you can access the wiki ( https://github.com/TheOrderMSU/TheOrderMSU/wiki ) to view the stories and biographical information for characters within the MSU Order universe. Our characters are created within all eras of the Legends timeline and our stories build off of the Star Wars Legends timeline, however we do incorporate the new timeline when appropriate.

Wiki pages are written in Markdown. Character entries may be submitted through the Characters channel on Discord, through Facebook, or the Issues tab. Do *not* copy and paste entire biographies for this. Please submit links for a Google Doc or similar.

**All entries will be reformatted for appropriate wiki and Markdown usage and readability.**

If there are any errors, please submit a request through the Issues link.

Some notes:
- The lineage tree is built on Mermaid script. To make the tree as accurate as possible, while also maintaining readability and accounting for the somewhat limited nature of Mermaid flowcharts, some liberties have to be taken. These usually caused by name or side changes.
- Much of the tree was formed through information found in various wiki entries, post from Facebook, and word of mouth. Discrepancies may occur and are usually resolved by consensus.
